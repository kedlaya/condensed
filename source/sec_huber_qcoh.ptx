    <title>Glueing modules over analytic rings</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        There are several different reasons why it is not reasonable to hope for a glueing statement about modules over analytic rings
        without any use of derived categories. We have seen two such reasons already: rational localizations are not flat
        <xref ref="rem-not-flat"/> and solid analytic rings are not necessarily sheafy (<xref ref="exa-local-sections-to-zero"/>).
        To this we may add a third: the definition of a rational localization <m>A \to B</m> involves a change in the module category
        (because we insist on modules being solid with respect to the new elements <m>f_i/g</m>) and this involves another operation
        which is not exact.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can fix these problems by considering derived categories of modules over solid analytic rings, except for the failure of sheafiness.
        For this, we need to allow ourselves to form the <term>derived rational localization</term> with respect to a sequence <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g</m>
        of parameters; this amounts to taking the Koszul complex associated to the ring <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m>
        and the elements <m>f_1 - g T_1, \dots, f_n - g T_n</m>. To handle this correctly requires deriving not just modules but rings,
        which we have already agreed not to do (<xref ref="rem-more-homotopical-rings"/>). We will thus result to assuming that all of the solid 
        analytic rings in the following discussion are sheafy, but keep in mind that this restriction is not really essential.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a sheafy solid analytic ring and choose <m>f,g \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> generating the unit ideal.
          Then the base extension functor
          <men xml:id="eq-derived-base-extension-functor-loose">
            D(\Mod_A) \to D(\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g \right\rangle}) \times_{D(\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g, g/f \right\rangle})} D(\Mod_{A \left\langle g/f \right\rangle})
          </men>
          is an equivalence of categories.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Each of the functors from <m>D(\Mod_A)</m> to one of the other categories has a right adjoint (restriction of scalars), so the same is true of
          the base extension. It thus remains to establish that the unit and the counit of this adjunction are equivalences.
          To simplify notation, let us rewrite <xref ref="eq-derived-base-extension-functor"/> as
          <me>
            D(\Mod_A) \to D(\Mod_{A_1}) \times_{D(\Mod_{A_{12}})} D(\Mod_{A_{2}}).
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To check the unit, note that by <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence"/>, the sequence <xref ref="eq-sheafy-exact-sequence"/> is exact.
          For any <m>M \in D(\Mod_A)</m>, we may take the (derived) tensor product of this sequence with <m>M</m> to obtain a morphism from the mapping cone of
          <me>
            M \otimes_A A_1 \oplus M \otimes_A A_2 \to M \otimes_A A_{12}
          </me>
          to <m>M</m> in <m>D(\Mod_A)</m> which inverts the adjunction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the counit, we first apply the universal property of localization to see that the multiplication maps
          <men xml:id="eq-double-base-extension">
            A_{S_1} \otimes^L_A A_{S_2} \to A_{S_1 \cup S_2}
          </men>
          are isomorphisms for any subsets <m>S_1, S_2</m> of <m>\{1,2\}</m>. Using these isomorphisms, we see that if we start with <m>M_i \in \Mod_{A_i}</m>
          and ismoorphisms <m>M_i \otimes_{A_i} A_{12} \cong M_{12}</m>, the counit is a map from <m>(M_1 \times_{M_{12}} M_2) \otimes^L_A A_i \in \Mod_{A_i}</m>
          to <m>M_i \otimes^L_A A_i</m> and then to <m>M_i</m>, and using <xref ref="eq-double-base-extension"/> we can produce inverses to both factors.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark xml:id="rem-no-sheaf-derived-category">
      <p>
        At this point, it is natural to ask whether <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/> can be formulated for
        a rational covering with more than two terms.
        In fact one cannot hope to make such a statement directly, 
        because the ordinary derived category of an abelian category does not have limits: one has to first lift
        a given diagram up to the level of chain complexes, and it is not always possible to make consistent choices to do that.
        This is not an issue for <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/>: we are taking the limit of a contractible diagram, so we never get backed
        into a corner when trying to reconcile our lifts. But already for a three-term covering the diagram is far from contractible:
          <figure>
            <image>
              <latex-image>
                \xymatrix{
                  A_1 \ar[r] \ar[dr] &amp; A_{12} \ar[dr] \\
                  A_2 \ar[ur] \ar[dr] &amp; A_{13} \ar[r] &amp; A_{123} \\
                  A_3 \ar[r] \ar[ur] &amp; A_{23} \ar[ur]
                }
              </latex-image>
            </image>
          </figure>
        and one cannot lift such a diagram in general from the derived category to the category of chain complexes.

    <title>Enter <m>\infty</m>-categories</title>
    <p>
      With <xref ref="rem-no-sheaf-derived-category"/> compelling us to go forward,
      we dip our toes into the vast sea that is <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Chapter 1.
      But first we need some background from the formalism of homotopy theory.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        By way of motivation, we first recall the classical hierarchy of categories.
        A category in the usual sense can also be called a <term><m>1</m>-category</term>: it has components at level 0
        (the objects) and level 1 (the morphisms). 
      </p>
      <p>
        If one seeks to put categories themselves into a category, the result is a <term><m>2</m>-category</term>: one has components at level 0 (the objects),
        level 1 (the functors), and level 2 (the natural transformations). In particular, an equality between two given morphisms of objects is no longer
        a property but a structure: one must specify the choice of a particular isomorphism between them, and this choice gets carried along when composing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to specify a 2-category is as a category enriched in <m>1</m>-categories: the morphisms between objects are not a set but rather a <m>1</m>-category.
        We may similarly define a <term>n</term>-category for any <m>n</m> by saying that a category enriched in <m>n</m>-categories is an <m>(n+1)</m>-category.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion of an <m>\infty</m>-category is meant to take a <q>limit over <m>n</m></q> in this process,
        but one can in fact jump directly to the limit.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Delta</m> be the category of <term>finite ordered sets</term>.
        That is, <m>\Delta</m> contains the objects <m>[0], [1], [2],\dots</m> where <m>[n] = \{0,1,2,\dots,n\}</m>,
        and a morphism <m>[n] \to [m]</m> is a nondecreasing map of sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any category <m>\calC</m>, a <term>simplicial object</term> in <m>\calC</m> is a contravariant functor <m>\Delta \to \calC</m>
        (i.e., a <q>presheaf</q> on <m>\Delta</m> valued in <m>\calC</m>).
        These form a category with morphisms being natural transformations of functors.
        For example, a simplicial object in sets will be called a <term>simplicial set</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        The <term>nerve</term> of a small category <m>\calC</m> is the simplicial set defined as follows. 
        The image of <m>[n]</m> is the set of all chains <m>x_0 \stackrel{f_0}{\to} x_1\stackrel{f_1}{\to} \cdots \stackrel{f_{n-1}}{\to} x_n</m>
        of composable morphisms in <m>\calC</m>; in particular, <m>[0]</m> maps to the set of objects and <m>[1]</m> to the set of morphisms.
        The map <m>[n] \to [m]</m> corresponds to <q>reparametrizing</q> the chain by inserting identity maps and/or composing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example has the <term>inner horn filling property</term>, which can be described as follows.
        For <m>n \geq 0</m>, let <m>\Delta^n</m> be the simplicial set represented by <m>[n] \in \Delta</m> (i.e., <m>[k] \mapsto \Hom_\Delta([k],[n])</m>
        (the <term>standard <m>n</m>-simplex</term>). For <m>0 \leq i \leq n</m>, let <m>\Lambda_i^n</m> be the simplicial subset
        obtained from <m>\Delta^n</m> by omitting all morphisms with image containing <m>\{0,\dots,n\} \setminus \{i\}</m> 
        (the <term><m>i</m>-th horn of <m>\Delta^n</m></term>).
        Then for any <m>i</m> with <m>0 \lt i \lt n</m>, any morphism of simplicial sets from <m>\Lambda_i^n</m> into the nerve extends uniquely to <m>\Delta^n</m>.
        For example, for <m>n=2, i=1</m> this is saying that any pair of composable arrows admits a unique composition.
        By contrast, filling the horn with <m>i=0</m> would say that any two morphisms with the same source have the property that each one factors through the other,
        which is almost never true.
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>small <m>\infty</m>-category</term> is a simplicial set <m>\calC</m> with the inner horn filling property:
        for <m>0 \lt i \lt n</m>, every map of simplicial sets from the horn <m>\Lambda_i^n</m> into <m>\calC</m> can be extended, <em>not necessarily uniquely</em>, 
        across the simplex <m>\Delta^n</m>.
        Using the nerve construction, we may view every small category as a small <m>\infty</m>-category.
        We use that example to set language; we refer to elements of <m>[0]</m> as <term>objects</term> in the <m>\infty</m>-category,
        elements of <m>[1]</m> as <term>morphisms</term> or <term>1-morphisms</term>, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <term><m>\infty</m>-category</term> is the same thing but without the set-theoretic restrictions.
        This requires some care with foundations which I will not exercise here.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>zero object</term> in an <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calC</m> is an object which is both initial and final.
        We say <m>\calC</m> is <term>pointed</term> if it admits a zero object, which we then conventionally call <m>0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>triangle</term> in a pointed <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calC</m> is a diagram <m>\Delta^1 \times \Delta^1 \to \calC</m> of the form
        <figure>
          <image>
            <latex-image>
              \xymatrix{
                X \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; Y \ar[d] \\
                0 \ar[r] &amp; Z
              }
            </latex-image>
          </image>
        </figure>
        where <m>0 \in \calC</m> is a zero object. We say that a triangle is a <term>fiber sequence</term> if the diagram is a pullback square;
        in this case we call the triangle a <term>fiber</term> of <m>Y \to Z</m>.
        Dually, we say that a triangle is a <term>cofiber sequence</term> if the diagram is a pushout square;
        in this case we call the triangle a <term>cofiber</term> of <m>X \to Y</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition xml:id="def-stable-infty-category">
      <p>
        An <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calC</m> is <term>stable</term> if the following conditions hold.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>\calC</m> is pointed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every morphism in <m>\calC</m> admits a fiber and a cofiber.
          </li>
          <li>
            A triangle in <m>\calC</m> is a fiber sequence if and only if it is a cofiber sequence.

    <remark>
      <p>
        Note that in <xref ref="def-stable-infty-category"/>, the last condition is desirable for derived categories because
        we want the concept of a triangle to be rotationally symmetric; in other words, we want the mapping cone of a morphism to satisfy a universal property
        on both sides.

    <title>Derived <m>\infty</m>-categories</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Let <m>\calA</m> be an abelian category. The traditional approach to constructing the derived category of <m>\calA</m>
        is to start with chain complexes valued in <m>\calA</m>, pass to the homotopy category (i.e., quotienting by any map homotopic to zero),
        then invert quasi-isomorphisms (maps that induces isomorphisms on cohomology groups). The trouble is that some operations we would want to perform on complexes
        are sensitive to how the <q>forgotten</q> homotopies fit together.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better approach would be to view the chain complexes as objects in an <m>\infty</m>-category, where 1-morphisms are morphisms of chain complexes,
        2-morphisms are chain homotopies between morphisms, and higher morphisms record higher compatibilies among chain homotopies.
        Taking the homotopy category of the result should then have the effect of inverting quasi-isomorphisms to get us back to the familiar setting.

      <p>
        A <term>differential graded category</term> is a category enriched over the category of chain complexes in <m>\Ab</m>.
        For <m>\calC</m> a differential graded category, the <term>differential graded nerve</term> <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m>
        is an <m>\infty</m>-category defined as in <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Construction 1.3.1.6 and verified to be an <m>\infty</m>-category in Proposition 1.3.1.10.
        While the general description is a bit dense, we can expand the low-order terms as in <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Example 1.3.1.8:
        <ul>
          <li>
            An object of <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is an object of <m>\calC</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 1-morphism of <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is a pair of objects <m>X,Y \in \calC</m> together with a 0-cocycle in <m>\Hom_{\calC}(X,Y)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 2-morphism of <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is a triple of objects <m>X,Y,Z \in \calC</m>, a triple of 1-morphisms <m>f\colon X \to Y</m>,
            <m>g\colon Y \to Z</m>, <m>h \colon X \to Z</m>, and a 1-cochain in <m>\Hom_{\calC}(X,Z)</m> with differential <m>(g\circ f) - h</m>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        When <m>\calC</m> is the category of chain complexes of an additive category, <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is stable (<xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Proposition 1.3.2.10).

        (as per <xref ref="rem-more-homotopical-rings"/>).
        We will not discuss this here.
