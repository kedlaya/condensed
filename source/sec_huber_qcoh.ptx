    <title>Glueing modules over analytic rings</title>
    <p>
      We first establish a glueing result for modules over analytic rings.
      However, to do this we must first point out a subtlety in the definition of rational localizations.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-loose-rational-localization">
      <p>
        Let <m>A \to B</m> be a rational localization of solid analytic rings corresponding to parameters
        <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g\in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> which generate the unit ideal.
        We can then factor this map through <m>A \to B_0</m>
        where
        <me>
          B_0 = (B^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{B^{\triangleright}} \times_{\Mod_{A^{\triangleright}}} \Mod_A)
        </me>;
        we call the map <m>A \to B_0</m> the <term>loose rational localization</term> defined by <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define the <term>loose adic topology</term> on <m>\AnRing^{\op}</m> as the Grothendieck topology
        generated by coverings by families of loose rational localizations <m>A \to A_{i,0}</m> arising from
        sequences <m>f_1,\dots,f_n \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> generating the unit ideal.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We start with the following generalization of <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence"/>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-general-mod-exact-on-binary-covering">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a solid analytic ring, for <m>f,g \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> which generate the unit ideal,
          for any <m>A \in \Mod_A</m>, the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \frac{f}{g} \right\rangle
            \oplus M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \frac{g}{f} \right\rangle \to
            M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \frac{f}{g}, \frac{g}{f} \right\rangle \to 0
          </me>
          is exact.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          In the case where <m>g=1</m> or <m>g=1-f</m> this was already established in <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence-v2"/>.
          By this plus <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/>,
          we may check the general case locally with respect to a refinement of the binary covering defined by <m>f,g</m>.
          In particular, we may assume without loss of generality that <m>A = A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \frac{f}{g} \right\rangle</m>,
          in which case also <m>A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \frac{g}{f} \right\rangle = A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \frac{f}{g}, \frac{g}{f} \right\rangle</m>
          and so the sequence in question is split exact.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-mod-to-qcoh-fully-faithful">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a solid analytic ring, for <m>f,g \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> which generate the unit ideal,
          the map
          <me>
            \Mod_A \to \Mod_{A \left\langle f/g \right\rangle_0} \times_{\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g, g/f \right\rangle_0}} \Mod_{A \left\langle g/f \right\rangle_0}            
          </me>
          is fully faithful.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is immediate from <xref ref="lem-general-mod-exact-on-binary-covering"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      Before continuing, it will be helpful to make a corresponding statement for derived categories.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring and choose <m>f,g \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> generating the unit ideal.
          Then the base extension functor
          <men xml:id="eq-derived-base-extension-functor-loose">
            D(\Mod_A) \to D(\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g \right\rangle_0}) \times_{D(\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g, g/f \right\rangle_0})} D(\Mod_{A \left\langle g/f \right\rangle_0})
          </men>
          is an equivalence of categories.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Each of the functors from <m>D(\Mod_A)</m> to one of the other categories has a right adjoint (restriction of scalars), so the same is true of
          the base extension. It thus remains to establish that the unit and the counit of this adjunction are equivalences.
          To simplify notation, let us rewrite <xref ref="eq-derived-base-extension-functor"/> as
          <me>
            D(\Mod_A) \to D(\Mod_{A_1}) \times_{D(\Mod_{A_{12}})} D(\Mod_{A_{2}}).
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To check the unit, note that by <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence"/>, the sequence <xref ref="eq-sheafy-exact-sequence"/> is exact.
          For any <m>M \in D(\Mod_A)</m>, we may take the (derived) tensor product of this sequence with <m>M</m> to obtain a morphism from the mapping cone of
          <me>
            M \otimes_A A_1 \oplus M \otimes_A A_2 \to M \otimes_A A_{12}
          </me>
          to <m>M</m> in <m>D(\Mod_A)</m> which inverts the adjunction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the counit, we first apply the universal property of localization to see that the multiplication maps
          <men xml:id="eq-double-base-extension">
            A_{S_1} \otimes^L_A A_{S_2} \to A_{S_1 \cup S_2}
          </men>
          are isomorphisms for any subsets <m>S_1, S_2</m> of <m>\{1,2\}</m>. Using these isomorphisms, we see that if we start with <m>M_i \in \Mod_{A_i}</m>
          and ismoorphisms <m>M_i \otimes_{A_i} A_{12} \cong M_{12}</m>, the counit is a map from <m>(M_1 \times_{M_{12}} M_2) \otimes^L_A A_i \in \Mod_{A_i}</m>
          to <m>M_i \otimes^L_A A_i</m> and then to <m>M_i</m>, and using <xref ref="eq-double-base-extension"/> we can produce inverses to both factors.

      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-mod-to-qcoh-fully-faithful"/>, the functor is fully faithful.
          To check essential surjectivity, we may apply <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/> to an element
          of the target category to obtain a complex concentrated in degrees 0 and 1.
          However, we can then apply <xref ref="lem-mod-to-qcoh-fully-faithful"/> again to see that the cohomology in degree 1 vanishes.

    <title>A few remarks</title>
    <p>
      At this point, a few remarks are in order.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-univ-injective-but-not-flat">
      <p>
        The truth of <xref ref="thm-mod-to-qcoh-equivalence"/> may seem surprising in light of the fact that tensoring with even a loose rational localizations
        is not an exact morphism (<xref ref="exa-localization-not-flat"/>). The point is that loose rational localizations are at least universally
        injective (<xref ref="cor-flat-mult-f-v2"/>) and this is sufficient for descent of modules (compare <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 08WE for the case of modules over discrete rings).
        However, the failure of base extension along a loose rational localization 
        to be flat is a compelling argument to introduce derived categories at this point.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-no-sheaf-derived-category">
      <p>
        In light of the failure of flatness even for loose rational localizations (<xref ref="rem-univ-injective-but-not-flat"/>),
        it is natural to ask whether <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/> can be upgraded to say that the derived categories of <m>\Mod_A</m>
        form a stack for the loose adic topology, in parallel with <xref ref="thm-mod-to-qcoh-equivalence"/>. 
        In fact one cannot hope to make such a statement, 
        because the ordinary derived category of an abelian category does not have limits: one has to first lift
        a given diagram up to the level of chain complexes, and it is not always possible to make consistent choices to do that.
        This is not an issue for <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/>: we are taking the limit of a contractible diagram, so we never get backed
        into a corner when trying to reconcile our lifts. But already for a three-term covering the diagram is far from contractible:
          <figure>
            <image>
              <latex-image>
                \xymatrix{
                  A_1 \ar[r] \ar[dr] &amp; A_{12} \ar[dr] \\
                  A_2 \ar[ur] \ar[dr] &amp; A_{13} \ar[r] &amp; A_{123} \\
                  A_3 \ar[r] \ar[ur] &amp; A_{23} \ar[ur]
                }
              </latex-image>
            </image>
          </figure>
        and one cannot lift such a diagram in general from the derived category to the category of chain complexes.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The issues raised in <xref ref="rem-univ-injective-but-not-flat"/> and <xref ref="rem-no-sheaf-derived-category"/> become more acute
        when we switch from the loose adic topology back to the adic topology, where
        <xref ref="lem-mod-to-qcoh-equivalence"/> no longer applies: the base extension along a rational localization
        includes an analytic completion step which is not exact. So the best we can hope to assert is that some sort of derived
        category of <m>\Mod_A</m> is a stack for the adic topology, but this is obstructed in the same manner
        as in <xref ref="rem-no-sheaf-derived-category"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a first step, we can at least formulate the analogue of <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/>.
        A complete resolution will have to wait until we introduce the <m>\infty</m>-categorical analogue of the
        derived category of <m>\Mod_A</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Enter <m>\infty</m>-categories</title>
    <p>
      With various reasons compelling us to do so (<xref ref="rem-univ-injective-but-not-flat"/>, <xref ref="rem-no-sheaf-derived-category"/>),
      we dip our toes into the vast sea that is <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Chapter 1.
      But first we need some background from the formalism of homotopy theory.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        By way of motivation, we first recall the classical hierarchy of categories.
        A category in the usual sense can also be called a <term><m>1</m>-category</term>: it has components at level 0
        (the objects) and level 1 (the morphisms). 
      </p>
      <p>
        If one seeks to put categories themselves into a category, the result is a <term><m>2</m>-category</term>: one has components at level 0 (the objects),
        level 1 (the functors), and level 2 (the natural transformations). In particular, an equality between two given morphisms of objects is no longer
        a property but a structure: one must specify the choice of a particular isomorphism between them, and this choice gets carried along when composing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to specify a 2-category is as a category enriched in <m>1</m>-categories: the morphisms between objects are not a set but rather a <m>1</m>-category.
        We may similarly define a <term>n</term>-category for any <m>n</m> by saying that a category enriched in <m>n</m>-categories is an <m>(n+1)</m>-category.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion of an <m>\infty</m>-category is meant to take a <q>limit over <m>n</m></q> in this process,
        but one can in fact jump directly to the limit.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Delta</m> be the category of <term>finite ordered sets</term>.
        That is, <m>\Delta</m> contains the objects <m>[0], [1], [2],\dots</m> where <m>[n] = \{0,1,2,\dots,n\}</m>,
        and a morphism <m>[n] \to [m]</m> is a nondecreasing map of sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any category <m>\calC</m>, a <term>simplicial object</term> in <m>\calC</m> is a contravariant functor <m>\Delta \to \calC</m>
        (i.e., a <q>presheaf</q> on <m>\Delta</m> valued in <m>\calC</m>).
        These form a category with morphisms being natural transformations of functors.
        For example, a simplicial object in sets will be called a <term>simplicial set</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        The <term>nerve</term> of a small category <m>\calC</m> is the simplicial set defined as follows. 
        The image of <m>[n]</m> is the set of all chains <m>x_0 \stackrel{f_0}{\to} x_1\stackrel{f_1}{\to} \cdots \stackrel{f_{n-1}}{\to} x_n</m>
        of composable morphisms in <m>\calC</m>; in particular, <m>[0]</m> maps to the set of objects and <m>[1]</m> to the set of morphisms.
        The map <m>[n] \to [m]</m> corresponds to <q>reparametrizing</q> the chain by inserting identity maps and/or composing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example has the <term>inner horn filling property</term>, which can be described as follows.
        For <m>n \geq 0</m>, let <m>\Delta^n</m> be the simplicial set represented by <m>[n] \in \Delta</m> (i.e., <m>[k] \mapsto \Hom_\Delta([k],[n])</m>
        (the <term>standard <m>n</m>-simplex</term>). For <m>0 \leq i \leq n</m>, let <m>\Lambda_i^n</m> be the simplicial subset
        obtained from <m>\Delta^n</m> by omitting all morphisms with image containing <m>\{0,\dots,n\} \setminus \{i\}</m> 
        (the <term><m>i</m>-th horn of <m>\Delta^n</m></term>).
        Then for any <m>i</m> with <m>0 \lt i \lt n</m>, any morphism of simplicial sets from <m>\Lambda_i^n</m> into the nerve extends uniquely to <m>\Delta^n</m>.
        For example, for <m>n=2, i=1</m> this is saying that any pair of composable arrows admits a unique composition.
        By contrast, filling the horn with <m>i=0</m> would say that any two morphisms with the same source have the property that each one factors through the other,
        which is almost never true.
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>small <m>\infty</m>-category</term> is a simplicial set <m>\calC</m> with the inner horn filling property:
        for <m>0 \lt i \lt n</m>, every map of simplicial sets from the horn <m>\Lambda_i^n</m> into <m>\calC</m> can be extended, <em>not necessarily uniquely</em>, 
        across the simplex <m>\Delta^n</m>.
        Using the nerve construction, we may view every small category as a small <m>\infty</m>-category.
        We use that example to set language; we refer to elements of <m>[0]</m> as <term>objects</term> in the <m>\infty</m>-category,
        elements of <m>[1]</m> as <term>morphisms</term> or <term>1-morphisms</term>, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <term><m>\infty</m>-category</term> is the same thing but without the set-theoretic restrictions.
        This requires some care with foundations which I will not exercise here.

    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>zero object</term> in an <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calC</m> is an object which is both initial and final.
        We say <m>\calC</m> is <term>pointed</term> if it admits a zero object, which we then conventionally call <m>0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>triangle</term> in a pointed <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calC</m> is a diagram <m>\Delta^1 \times \Delta^1 \to \calC</m> of the form

        where <m>0 \in \calC</m> is a zero object. We say that a triangle is a <term>fiber sequence</term> if the diagram is a pullback square;
        in this case we call the triangle a <term>fiber</term> of <m>Y \to Z</m>.
        Dually, we say that a triangle is a <term>cofiber sequence</term> if the diagram is a pushout square;
        in this case we call the triangle a <term>cofiber</term> of <m>X \to Y</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition xml:id="def-stable-infty-category">

        Note that in <xref ref="def-stable-infty-category"/>, the last condition is desirable for derived categories because

        on both sides.

    <title>Derived <m>\infty</m>-categories</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Let <m>\calA</m> be an abelian category. The traditional approach to constructing the derived category of <m>\calA</m>
        is to start with chain complexes valued in <m>\calA</m>, pass to the homotopy category (i.e., quotienting by any map homotopic to zero),
        then invert quasi-isomorphisms (maps that induces isomorphisms on cohomology groups). The trouble is that some operations we would want to perform on complexes
        are sensitive to how the <q>forgotten</q> homotopies fit together.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better approach would be to view the chain complexes as objects in an <m>\infty</m>-category, where 1-morphisms are morphisms of chain complexes,
        2-morphisms are chain homotopies between morphisms, and higher morphisms record higher compatibilies among chain homotopies.
        Taking the homotopy category of the result should then have the effect of inverting quasi-isomorphisms to get us back to the familiar setting.

    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>differential graded category</term> is a category enriched over the category of chain complexes in <m>\Ab</m>.
        For <m>\calC</m> a differential graded category, the <term>differential graded nerve</term> <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m>
        is an <m>\infty</m>-category defined as in <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Construction 1.3.1.6 and verified to be an <m>\infty</m>-category in Proposition 1.3.1.10.
        While the general description is a bit dense, we can expand the low-order terms as in <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Example 1.3.1.8:
        <ul>
          <li>
            An object of <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is an object of <m>\calC</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 1-morphism of <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is a pair of objects <m>X,Y \in \calC</m> together with a 0-cocycle in <m>\Hom_{\calC}(X,Y)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 2-morphism of <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is a triple of objects <m>X,Y,Z \in \calC</m>, a triple of 1-morphisms <m>f\colon X \to Y</m>,
            <m>g\colon Y \to Z</m>, <m>h \colon X \to Z</m>, and a 1-cochain in <m>\Hom_{\calC}(X,Z)</m> with differential <m>(g\circ f) - h</m>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        When <m>\calC</m> is the category of chain complexes of an additive category, <m>N_{\dg}(\calC)</m> is stable (<xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Proposition 1.3.2.10).

        An abelian category <m>\calA</m> is <term>Grothendieck</term> if it is presentable and the collection of monomorphisms is closed under small filtered colimits.
        This condition guarantees that <m>\calA</m> has enough injectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The category of condensed abelian groups is Grothendieck; more generally, for any analytic ring <m>A</m>, <m>\Mod_A</m> is Grothendieck
        (using the analytifications of <m>A^{\triangleright}[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m> as generators).

        Let <m>\calA</m> be a Grothendieck abelian category. 
        Let <m>\Ch(\calA)</m> denote the category of chain complexes valued in <m>\calA</m>.
        Let <m>\Ch(\calA)^\circ</m> be the full subcategory of <term>fibrant</term> objects in <m>\calA</m> for the model structure described in <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, 
        Proposition 1.3.5.3; per <xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Proposition 1.3.5.6, any fibrant object is a complex of injective objects, and any bounded above complex of injective
        objects is fibrant.
        Let <m>\calD(\calA) := N_{\dg}(\Ch(\calA)^{\circ})</m>; this <m>\infty</m>-category is stable (<xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Proposition 1.3.5.9).
        It can also be viewed as the underlying <m>\infty</m>-category of the model category <m>\Ch(\calA)</m> (<xref ref="bib-Lurie-HA"/>, Proposition 1.3.5.15).
        We refer to <m>\calD(\calA)</m> as the <term>derived <m>\infty</m>-category</term> associated to <m>\calA</m>.

    <title>Glueing for quasicoherent sheaves</title>
    <p>
      We now state the descent theorem for the derived <m>\infty</m>-category of quasicoherent sheaves.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any solid analytic ring <m>A</m>,
          the assignment <m>A \mapsto \calD(\QCoh(A))</m> is a sheaf on <m>\AnRing^{\op}_{\solid/A}</m> for both the
          adic topology and the loose adic topology. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We check descent for a covering as in <xref ref="lem-standard-rational-covering"/>.
          That is, given <m>f_1,\dots,f_n \in A^{\triangleright}</m> generating the unit ideal, set
          <m>A_i := A \left\langle \tfrac{f_1}{f_i},\dots,\tfrac{f_n}{f_i} \right\rangle</m>
          and for any subset <m>S</m> of <m>\{1,\dots,n\}</m>, let <m>A_S</m> be the tensor product of <m>A_i</m> over <m>A</m> for <m>i</m> ranging over <m>S</m>.
          By <xref ref="thm-solid-sheafy"/>, we have an exact sequence
          <men xml:id="eq-exact-seq-general-covering">
            0 \to A \to \bigoplus_i A_i \to \bigoplus_{i \lt j} A_{ij} \to \cdots
          </men>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we need to check is that <m>\calD(\QCoh_A)</m> is the limit of the diagram formed by the categories <m>\calD(\QCoh_{A_S})</m>
          for <m>S</m> running over all nonempty subsets of <m>\{1,\dots,n\}</m>, with an arrow <m>\calD(\QCoh_{A_S}) \to \calD(\QCoh_{A_T})</m> 
          whenever <m>S</m> is a subset of <m>T</m>. The point is that since we are now working with derived <m>\infty</m>-categories, 
          the functor from <m>\calD(\QCoh_A)</m> to the diagram again has a right adjoint
          given by taking a (finite) limit over the diagram, 
          and we can argue as before. Namely, we see that the unit is an isomorphism by tensoring with <xref ref="eq-exact-seq-general-covering"/>,
          and we see that the counit is an isomorphism using the equality <xref ref="eq-double-base-extension"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark xml:id="rem-quasicoherent-sheaves-general-analytic">
      <p>
        Since we are now working in terms of stable <m>\infty</m>-categories, it would also be straightforward to relax the hypothesis on <m>A</m>
        in <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> by viewing the derived localizations of <m>A</m> as ring objects in a suitable sense
        (e.g., as <m>E_\infty</m>-commutative ring objects in <m>\calD(\CAb)</m>).
        However, we will not need to do this.
