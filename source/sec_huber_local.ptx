  <title>Localization for solid analytic rings</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we indicate how the sheaf theory of Huber rings translates into the setting of solid analytic rings.
      In the process, we patch a major technical complication
      in the usual theory of adic spaces, namely the failure of <q>sheafiness</q> for general Huber rings,
      at the expense of passing from Huber rings to solid analytic rings which may not be represented by topological rings.

        In the following discussion, at certain points we will need to assume that 
        we are working with a solid condensed ring <m>A</m> which admits a topologically nilpotent unit <m>q</m>.
        When this is not the case, we can formally push ourselves back into that situation by replacing
        <m>A</m> with <m>A \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ} \solid} \underline{\ZZ((q))}</m>, noting that
        the map <m>A \to A \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ} \solid} \underline{\ZZ((q))}</m> is split in <m>\Mod_A \times_{\CAb} \CAb_\solid</m> 
        by the constant coefficient map.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can make a similar construction starting with a Huber ring <m>A</m>: choose a ring of definition <m>A_0</m>
        and an ideal of definition <m>I_0</m>, complete <m>A_0[q]</m> with respect to the <m>(I_0,q)</m>-adic topology,
        then tensor over <m>A_0[q]</m> with <m>A[q^{\pm}]</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="cor-tensor-with-liquid-T">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring. 
          Then for any <m>M \in \Mod_{A}</m>, the coordinate map
          <me>
            M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright}\langle T \rangle \to \prod_\NN M
          </me>
        is injective.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By rewriting 
          <me>
            M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle 
            \cong M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_{\underline{\ZZ}\solid} \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle
          </me>
          we reduce to the case <m>A = (\underline{\ZZ}, \Mod_{\underline{\ZZ} \solid})</m>.
          Hereafter, we implicitly apply <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/> to transfer results
          between <m>\Ab_\solid</m> and <m>\CAb_\solid</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next pass through a sequence of reduction steps on <m>M</m>.
          By <xref ref="prop-finitely-presented-generators-solid"/>, we may assume that <m>M</m>
          is finitely presented. 
          By <xref ref="cor-solid-torsion-by-free"/>, we have a splitting
          <me>
            M = \left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ} \right) \oplus \iExt^1_{\underline{\ZZ}}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})
          </me>
          where <m>I</m> is at most countable and <m>Q</m> is an at most countable abelian group,
          and we may treat the two factors separately.
          For the first factor, using the compatibility of solid tensor product with countable products,
          we may reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton, at which point the claim is apparent.        
          For the second factor, using <xref ref="rem-reduce-to-torsion-and-Q"/> we may further reduce to the cases where <m>Q</m>
          is either a torsion group or a <m>\QQ</m>-vector space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>M = \iExt^1_{\underline{\ZZ}}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})</m> where <m>Q</m> is a torsion group. 
          Using <xref ref="prop-ext-as-pontryagin-dual"/> and the compatibility of solid tensor product
          with countable limits, we may reduce to the case where <m>Q</m> is itself finite.
          By the usual structure theorem for finite abelian groups, we may further assume <m>Q</m> is even cyclic,
          say <m>Q = \ZZ/m\ZZ</m> and hence <m>M \cong \underline{\ZZ/m\ZZ}</m>.
          At this point, we must check that for any at most countable set <m>I</m>,
          an element of <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle \right)</m>
          is divisible by <m>m</m> if its image in
          <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \llbracket T \llbracket \right)</m>
          is divisible by <m>m</m>.
          Now identify the elements of
          <me>
            \Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \llbracket T \rrbracket \right)
            = \prod_\NN \bigoplus_I \ZZ
          </me>
          with <m>\NN \times I</m> matrices whose row vectors have finite support,
          and the elements of 
          <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle \right)</m>
          with <m>\NN \times I</m> matrices whose row and column vectors have finite support. 
          From this description,
          it is clear that dividing out a factor of <m>m</m> does not disturb any support conditions;
          alternatively, since we already start with a support condition on row vectors,
          we may reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton, which is apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>M = \iExt^1_{\underline{\ZZ}}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})</m> where <m>Q</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-vector space. 
          By <xref ref="exa-extension-solid-Q"/>, we then have <m>M \cong \prod_J \underline{\widehat{\ZZ}/\ZZ}</m> for some <m>I</m> with <m>|J| \leq \kappa</m>;
          we again reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton.
          At this point, we must check that for any at most countable set <m>I</m>,
          an element of <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\widehat{\ZZ}} \langle T \rangle \right)</m>
          factors through <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle \right)</m> if its 
          image in <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\widehat{\ZZ}} \llbracket T \rrbracket \right)</m>
          factors through <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \llbracket T \rrbracket \right)</m>.
          Using the matrix interpretation from the previous paragraph, we reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton, which is apparent.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-flat-mult-f">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring,

          Then for any <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>,
          multiplication by <m>1-fT</m> is an injective map on both

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Using <xref ref="cor-tensor-with-liquid-T"/>, we reduce to the corresponding assertion for <m>\prod_\NN M</m>,
          on which multiplication by <m>1-fT</m> is an isomorphism.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-flat-mult-f-v2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring, 
          and fix <m>f \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>.
          Then for any <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>,
          multiplication by <m>T-f</m> is an injective map on both 
          <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]</m> and <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The statement for <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]= \bigoplus_{n \in \NN} MT^n</m> is obvious because <m>T-f</m> is a monic polynomial.
          For  <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}\langle T \rangle</m>, we break the argument into various cases.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is a module over <m>A^{\triangleright}[1/f]</m>, then <m>T-f</m> and <m>1-f^{-1} T</m> have the same kernel on <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]_{\liquid T}</m>
                and we may invoke <xref ref="lem-flat-mult-f"/>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion-free, then <m>M</m> embeds into <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[1/f]</m> and the previous case applies.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is killed by <m>f^m</m> for some positive integer <m>m</m>, then multiplication by <m>T^m</m> on <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[1/f]</m> 
                is visibly injective, but this coincides with multiplication by <m>T^m-f^m = (T-f)(T^{m-1} + fT^{m-2} + \cdots + f^{m-1})</m>.
                Consequently, multiplication by <m>T-f</m> is also injective.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion, then it is the colimit of its submodules killed by <m>f^m</m> over all <m>m \in \NN</m>
                and the previous case applies.

              <p>
                Finally, in the general case we have an exact sequence

                in which <m>M[f^\infty]</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion and <m>M/M[f^\infty]</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion-free.
                Hence we may reduce to previously settled cases.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The tensor product in <m>A</m> is right exact by Hom-tensor adjunction,
          and exactness at the left is preserved by <xref ref="lem-flat-mult-f-v2"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark xml:id="rem-not-flat">
      <p>
        Note that <xref ref="cor-flat-mult-f-v2"/> does not imply that <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle f \rangle</m> is a flat object of <m>\Mod_A</m>
        (i.e., tensoring with it is exact); this is not the case as can be seen from <xref ref="exa-localization-not-flat"/>.
        Rather, we only conclude that the connecting homomorphism out of the first Tor group is always zero.
        In particular, we deduce that <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m> is a universally injective
        (by <xref ref="cor-tensor-with-liquid-T"/>) but not flat object of <m>\Mod_A</m>;
        in particular, <m>\ZZ \langle T \rangle</m> is a universally injective but not flat object of <m>\Mod_{\ZZ\solid}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that this failure of flatness holds even when when <m>A</m> is a strongly noetherian Huber ring, in which case the map from <m>A</m>
        to any rational localization is flat in the algebraic sense (<xref ref="bib-Huber2"/>, proof of Theorem 2.5, case II, point (II.1.iv)).
        There is no contradiction here because the two notions of flatness concern different tensor product functors.

        We will have more to say about this point in <xref ref="sec_huber_qcoh"/>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-solid-split-laurent-poly-ring">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any solid condensed ring <m>R</m>, the map
          <me>
            R\langle T \rangle \oplus T^{-1} R\langle T^{-1} \rangle \to R\langle T^{\pm} \rangle := R \langle T,U \rangle / (TU-1)
          </me>
          is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p> 
          It suffices to treat the case <m>R = \underline{\ZZ}</m>, as we obtain the general case by taking a solid tensor product with <m>R</m> over <m>\ZZ</m>.
          We may treat that case in either <m>\Ab_\solid</m> or <m>\CAb_\solid</m> by virtue of <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>;
          we do both for the sake of illustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>\Ab_\solid</m>, evaluating <m>\underline{\ZZ}\langle T,T^{-1} \rangle</m> at <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> yields 
          the intersection of <m>\prod_I \ZZ[T,T^{-1}]</m> and <m>\prod_\ZZ \bigoplus_I \ZZ</m> within <m>\prod_\ZZ \prod_I \ZZ</m>.
          This clearly splits into the two indicated summands.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>\CAb_\solid</m>, evaluating at <m>S  = \varprojlim_i S_i \in \Prof</m> has the following effect:
          for <m>R \langle T \rangle</m> we get power series <m>\sum_n a_n T^n</m> in which the coefficients <m>a_n</m> 
          are finite sums of <m>\ZZ</m>-valued Dirac measures
          with the property that for any fixed closed-open subset <m>U</m> of <m>S</m>, 
          the integral of <m>U</m> against <m>a_n</m> is eventually zero.
          From the corresponding descriptions for <m>R\langle T^{-1} \rangle</m> and <m> R\langle T^{\pm} \rangle</m>,
          we infer the desired exact sequence.

          moreover, <m>H^i(\AnSpec A, \calO) = 0</m> for <m>i \gt 0</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence-v1"/>, we have the sheaf property and the vanishing of higher Cech cohomology for standard binary coverings

          Using <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/>, we may parlay this into the sheaf property and the vanishing of higher Cech cohomology for general coverings.
          The latter formally implies the vanishing of higher sheaf cohomology.

    <title>Sheafiness for Huber rings</title>
    <p>
      We now introduce the structure presheaf of a Huber pair and study the extent to which it does or does not satisfy the sheaf property.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> a Huber pair, the <term>structure presheaf</term> <m>\calO</m> on <m>\Spa A</m>
        assigns to every rational subspace <m>U\left( \tfrac{f_1,\dots,f_n}{g} \right)</m>
        the quotient of <m>A\left\langle \tfrac{f_1}{g}, \dots, \tfrac{f_n}{g} \right\rangle^{\triangleright}</m> indicated in <xref ref="rem-rational-subspace-derived"/>.
        (It is then extended to arbitrary open subspaces by taking stalks.)
        We say <m>A</m> is <term>locally Tate</term> if <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> generates the unit ideal in <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>; this is equivalent to saying that
        <m>\Spa A</m> admits a covering by rational subspaces each of whose associated Huber ring is Tate.
        (This condition is called <term>analytic</term> in <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, but that terminology clashes with the notion of an <term>analytic ring</term> being used throughout these notes.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We say <m>A</m> is <term>sheafy</term> if <m>\calO</m> is a sheaf. This is a property of the underlying Huber ring <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>
        (which must in particular be complete).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-sheafy-by-localizations-are-Huber">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The complete Tate Huber pair <m>A</m> is sheafy if and only if for every rational localization <m>\underline{A^{\triangleright}} \to B^{\triangleright}</m> at the level of solid analytic rings,
          <m>B^{\triangleright}</m> again represents a complete Huber ring.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For the <q>if</q> assertion, we may deduce the claim from <xref ref="thm-solid-sheafy"/>,
          plus <xref ref="def-solid-Tate"/> in order to compare the concepts of Tate algebras (and by extension rational localizations)
          in the Huber setting and the solid setting. The latter is why we need <m>A</m> to be Tate.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the <q>only if</q> assertion, we need to check that the rational localization of Huber rings defined by the elements <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g \in A^{\triangleright}</m>
          (which generate the unit ideal) is resolved by the Koszul complex defined by <m>f_1 - g T_1, \dots, f_n - g T_n</m> in
          <m>A^{\triangleright}\langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m>, as then <xref ref="rem-localization-is-underived"/> will imply that the rational localization
          of Huber rings coincides with the rational localization of condensed rings.
          Since <m>A</m> is sheafy we may check this locally. By applying <xref ref="lem-standard-rational-covering"/> to the rational
          covering defined by <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g</m>, we reduce to checking the claim for a rational localization in a standard binary covering
          generated by <m>1,f</m> for some <m>f \in A^{\circ}</m>. That is, we need to show that if <m>f \in A^\circ</m>, 
          then the multiplication maps by <m>1-fT</m> and <m>f-T</m> in <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m> are strict inclusions;
          this can be seen by working in terms of graded rings, as in <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, Lemma 1.8.2.
          (The ultimate point is that in any univariate polynomial ring, an element cannot be a zero divisor if either its constant coefficient or its leading coefficient is a unit.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-sheafy-acyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is a sheafy Huber pair, then <m>H^i(\Spa(A), \calO) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          When <m>A</m> is Tate,
          this follows by combining <xref ref="thm-solid-sheafy"/> with <xref ref="prop-sheafy-by-localizations-are-Huber"/>
          and a general spectral sequence argument (compare <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, Tag 01EW 
          and <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, Lemma 1.6.3).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the general case, we need a slightly different argument.
          We may apply <xref ref="rem-adjoin-top-nilpotent"/> to replace <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> with <m>A^{\triangleright}((q))</m>,
          but it does not formally follow that the latter is sheafy.
          Nonetheless, we may argue as in <xref ref="prop-sheafy-by-localizations-are-Huber"/>
          that every rational localization of <m>\underline{A^{\triangleright}((q))}</m>
          which is a base extension from <m>A</m> does represent a complete Huber ring;
          we may then continue as in the previous paragraph.
        </p>
      </proof>

      <p>
        <xref ref="cor-sheafy-acyclic"/> was previously shown by Kedlaya<ndash/>Liu for <m>A</m> locally Tate; see <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, Theorem 1.3.4.

        The sheafy condition for Huber pairs is somewhat subtle; it is known to hold in certain classes (e.g., for strongly noetherian Huber rings
        in the sense of <xref ref="exa-strongly-noetherian"/>, and for perfectoid rings) and to fail in certain carefully constructed examples,
        but in most cases it is difficult to decide whether a given Huber pair is sheafy.

    <title>Solid adic spaces</title>
    <p>
      Although this discussion is aimed towards a study of analytic stacks, it may be useful for conceptual purposes to note that we can 
      already define something analogous to the category of schemes.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>\LRS</m> denote the category of <term>locally ringed spaces</term>.
        An object of <m>\LRS</m> is a topological space <m>X</m> equipped with a sheaf of rings <m>\calO_X</m> with the property that for each <m>x \in X</m>,
        the stalk <m>\calO_{X,x}</m> is a local ring (a ring with a unique maximal ideal).
        A morphism <m>(Y, \calO_Y) \to (X, \calO_X)</m> of <m>\LRS</m> consists of a continuous map <m>f\colon Y \to X</m>
        together with a ring homomorphism <m>f^\sharp\colon \calO_X \to f_*\calO_Y</m> which, for each <m>y \in Y</m> mapping to <m>x \in X</m>,
        induces a local homomorphism <m>\calO_{X,x} \to \calO_{Y,y}</m> of local rings (i.e., the maximal ideal contracts to the maximal ideal).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In <m>\LRS</m>, the affine scheme <m>\Spec R</m> corresponding to <m>R \in \Ring</m> has the following universal property:
        for every <m>X \in \LRS</m>, homomorphisms <m>R \to \Gamma(X, \calO_X)</m> correspond to morphisms <m>X \to \Spec R</m> via taking global sections.
        In other words, <m>\Spec</m> is right adjoint to the global sections functor <m>\LRS \to \Ring^{\op}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course we can also construct other interesting objects in <m>\LRS</m>: topological manifolds, smooth (<m>C^{\infty}</m>) manifolds, real analytic manifolds,
        complex analytic manifolds, complex analytic varieties, adic spaces, etc.
        While the adjunction property of <m>\Spec</m> tells us exactly how these other objects map to affine schemes, it does not explain how they map to more general schemes.
        In fact this is quite an interesting matter!

        Let <m>\LCRS</m> be the category of <term>locally condensed ringed spaces</term> as follows.
        An object of <m>\LCRS</m> is a topological space <m>X</m> equipped with a sheaf of condensed rings <m>\calO_X</m> with the property that for each <m>x \in X</m>,
        the stalk <m>\calO_{X,x}(*)</m> is a local ring (without topology).
        A morphism <m>(Y, \calO_Y) \to (X, \calO_X)</m> of <m>\LRS</m> consists of a continuous map <m>f\colon Y \to X</m>
        together with a condensed ring homomorphism <m>f^\sharp\colon \calO_X \to f_*\calO_Y</m> which, for each <m>y \in Y</m> mapping to <m>x \in X</m>,

        Let <m>\LCRS_\solid</m> be the subcategory of <term>locally solid ringed spaces</term>, i.e., the locally condensed ringed spaces <m>X</m> for which the sheaf 
        takes values in solid condensed rings. By <xref ref="thm-solid-sheafy"/>, for any solid analytic ring <m>A</m>,
        we may define an object <m>\AnSpec A \in \LCRS_\solid</m>
        with underlying topological space <m>\Spa(A(*))</m> (for the discrete topology on <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>); we call this the <term>(solid) adic spectrum</term> of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>solid adic space</term> is a locally condensed ringed space admitting a open covering by subspaces each of which is the solid adic spectrum
        of some solid analytic ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-solid-P1">
      <p>
        We obtain a solid adic space <m>\PP^1_{\solid}</m> by glueing <m>\AnSpec \ZZ[T]_\solid</m> and <m>\AnSpec \ZZ[T^{-1}]_\solid</m>
        along <m>\AnSpec \ZZ[T,T^{-1}]_\solid</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <m>\PP^1_{\solid}</m> admits a natural map to <m>\PP^1_\ZZ</m>, induced by the maps <m>\AnSpec \ZZ[T]_\solid \to \Spec \ZZ[T]</m>,
        <m>\AnSpec \ZZ[T^{-1}]_\solid \to \Spec \ZZ[T^{-1}]</m>.
        We will study this map later in the context of <term>analytification</term> (<xref ref="sec_gaga"/>).

      <p>
        Now choose a topologically nilpotent unit <m>q \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>.
        Then the action of <m>q^\ZZ</m> on <m>\GG_{m,A}</m> is free, so we can quotient to form a new solid adic space <m>\GG_{m,A}/q^\ZZ</m>,
        the <term>Tate elliptic curve</term> over <m>A</m>. It can be shown that this construction can be <q>algebraized</q>;
        we will return to this point later in a more general setting.
