    <title>On the formation of rational localizations</title>
    <p>
      We break down the structure of rational localizations in somewhat more detail.

    <remark xml:id="rem-adjoin-top-nilpotent">
      <p>
        In the following discussion, at certain points we will need to assume that 
        we are working with a solid condensed ring <m>A</m> which admits a topologically nilpotent unit <m>q</m>.
        When this is not the case, we can formally push ourselves back into that situation by replacing
        <m>A</m> with <m>A \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ} \solid} \underline{\ZZ((q))}</m>, noting that
        the map <m>A \to A \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ} \solid} \underline{\ZZ((q))}</m> is split in <m>\Mod_A \times_{\CAb} \CAb_\solid</m> 
        by the constant coefficient map.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can make a similar construction starting with a Huber ring <m>A</m>: choose a ring of definition <m>A_0</m>
        and an ideal of definition <m>I_0</m>, complete <m>A_0[q]</m> with respect to the <m>(I_0,q)</m>-adic topology,
        then tensor over <m>A_0[q]</m> with <m>A[q^{\pm}]</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="cor-tensor-with-liquid-T">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring. 
          Then for any <m>M \in \Mod_{A}</m>, the coordinate map
          <me>
            M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright}\langle T \rangle \to \prod_\NN M
          </me>
          is injective.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By rewriting 
          <me>
            M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle 
            \cong M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_{\underline{\ZZ}\solid} \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle
          </me>
          we reduce to the case <m>A = (\underline{\ZZ}, \Mod_{\underline{\ZZ} \solid})</m>.
          Hereafter, we implicitly apply <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/> to transfer results
          between <m>\Ab_\solid</m> and <m>\CAb_\solid</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next pass through a sequence of reduction steps on <m>M</m>.
          By <xref ref="prop-finitely-presented-generators-solid"/>, we may assume that <m>M</m>
          is finitely presented. 
          By <xref ref="cor-solid-torsion-by-free"/>, we have a splitting
          <me>
            M = \left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ} \right) \oplus \iExt^1_{\underline{\ZZ}}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})
          </me>
          where <m>I</m> is at most countable and <m>Q</m> is an at most countable abelian group,
          and we may treat the two factors separately.
          For the first factor, using the compatibility of solid tensor product with countable products,
          we may reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton, at which point the claim is apparent.        
          For the second factor, using <xref ref="rem-reduce-to-torsion-and-Q"/> we may further reduce to the cases where <m>Q</m>
          is either a torsion group or a <m>\QQ</m>-vector space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>M = \iExt^1_{\underline{\ZZ}}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})</m> where <m>Q</m> is a torsion group. 
          Using <xref ref="prop-ext-as-pontryagin-dual"/> and the compatibility of solid tensor product
          with countable limits, we may reduce to the case where <m>Q</m> is itself finite.
          By the usual structure theorem for finite abelian groups, we may further assume <m>Q</m> is even cyclic,
          say <m>Q = \ZZ/m\ZZ</m> and hence <m>M \cong \underline{\ZZ/m\ZZ}</m>.
          At this point, we must check that for any at most countable set <m>I</m>,
          an element of <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle \right)</m>
          is divisible by <m>m</m> if its image in
          <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \llbracket T \llbracket \right)</m>
          is divisible by <m>m</m>.
          Now identify the elements of
          <me>
            \Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \llbracket T \rrbracket \right)
            = \prod_\NN \bigoplus_I \ZZ
          </me>
          with <m>\NN \times I</m> matrices whose row vectors have finite support,
          and the elements of 
          <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle \right)</m>
          with <m>\NN \times I</m> matrices whose row and column vectors have finite support. 
          From this description,
          it is clear that dividing out a factor of <m>m</m> does not disturb any support conditions;
          alternatively, since we already start with a support condition on row vectors,
          we may reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton, which is apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>M = \iExt^1_{\underline{\ZZ}}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})</m> where <m>Q</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-vector space. 
          By <xref ref="exa-extension-solid-Q"/>, we then have <m>M \cong \prod_J \underline{\widehat{\ZZ}/\ZZ}</m> for some <m>I</m> with <m>|J| \leq \kappa</m>;
          we again reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton.
          At this point, we must check that for any at most countable set <m>I</m>,
          an element of <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\widehat{\ZZ}} \langle T \rangle \right)</m>
          factors through <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle \right)</m> if its 
          image in <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\widehat{\ZZ}} \llbracket T \rrbracket \right)</m>
          factors through <m>\Hom_{\underline{\ZZ}}\left( \prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \llbracket T \rrbracket \right)</m>.
          Using the matrix interpretation from the previous paragraph, we reduce to the case where <m>I</m> is a singleton, which is apparent.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-flat-mult-f">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring, 
          and fix <m>f \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>.
          Then for any <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>,
          multiplication by <m>1-fT</m> is an injective map on both 
          <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]</m> and <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}\langle T \rangle</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Using <xref ref="cor-tensor-with-liquid-T"/>, we reduce to the corresponding assertion for <m>\prod_\NN M</m>,
          on which multiplication by <m>1-fT</m> is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-flat-mult-f-v2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring, 
          and fix <m>f \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>.
          Then for any <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>,
          multiplication by <m>T-f</m> is an injective map on both 
          <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]</m> and <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The statement for <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]= \bigoplus_{n \in \NN} MT^n</m> is obvious because <m>T-f</m> is a monic polynomial.
          For  <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}\langle T \rangle</m>, we break the argument into various cases.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is a module over <m>A^{\triangleright}[1/f]</m>, then <m>T-f</m> and <m>1-f^{-1} T</m> have the same kernel on <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]_{\liquid T}</m>
                and we may invoke <xref ref="lem-flat-mult-f"/>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion-free, then <m>M</m> embeds into <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[1/f]</m> and the previous case applies.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is killed by <m>f^m</m> for some positive integer <m>m</m>, then multiplication by <m>T^m</m> on <m>M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[1/f]</m> 
                is visibly injective, but this coincides with multiplication by <m>T^m-f^m = (T-f)(T^{m-1} + fT^{m-2} + \cdots + f^{m-1})</m>.
                Consequently, multiplication by <m>T-f</m> is also injective.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>M</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion, then it is the colimit of its submodules killed by <m>f^m</m> over all <m>m \in \NN</m>
                and the previous case applies.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Finally, in the general case we have an exact sequence
                <me>
                  0 \to M[f^\infty] := \colim_n \ker(f^n, M) \to M \to M/M[f^\infty] \to 0
                </me>
                in which <m>M[f^\infty]</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion and <m>M/M[f^\infty]</m> is <m>f</m>-torsion-free.
                Hence we may reduce to previously settled cases.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The tensor product in <m>A</m> is right exact by Hom-tensor adjunction,
          and exactness at the left is preserved by <xref ref="lem-flat-mult-f-v2"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <p>
      We note some limitations of the previous discussion.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exa-local-sections-to-zero">
      <p>
        By contrast with <xref ref="cor-flat-mult-f-v2"/>, the morphism <m>\times (T-f)</m> 
        on <m>A^{\triangleright}\langle T^{\pm} \rangle</m> in <m>\Mod_A</m> is not necessarily injective, let alone universally injective.
        The following example is essentially that of Rost from <xref ref="bib-Huber2"/>, end of section 1;
        by replacing the base ring <m>\ZZ</m> with a nonarchimedean field one can make an example where <m>A</m> is a Tate Huber ring,
        which then reproduces <xref ref="bib-Buzzard-Verberkmoes"/>, Proposition 12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fix <m>c \in (0,1)</m>,
        let <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> be the completion of <m>\ZZ[f^{\pm},Z]/(Z^2)</m>
        for the submultiplicative norm 
        <me>
          \left| \sum_{n \in \ZZ} a_n f^n + \sum_{n \in \ZZ} b_n f^n Z \right| = \max_{n \in \ZZ} \{|a_n| c^{-|n|}, |b_n| c^{|n|}\}
        </me>,
        and take <m>A^+</m> to be the elements of norm at most <m>1</m>. Then <m>A = (A^{\triangleright}, A^+)</m> is a complete Huber ring
        and 
        <me>
          x := \sum_{n \in \ZZ} f^{-n} Z T^n
        </me>
        is a well-defined nonzero element of <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T^{\pm} \rangle</m> such that <m>(T-f)x = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-not-flat">
      <p>
        <xref ref="cor-flat-mult-f-v2"/> does not imply that <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle f \rangle</m> is a flat object of <m>\Mod_A</m>
        (meaning that tensoring with it is exact); indeed, the failure of flatness can be seen from <xref ref="exa-localization-not-flat"/>.
        Rather, we only conclude that the connecting homomorphism out of the first Tor group is always zero.
        In particular, we deduce that <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m> is a universally injective
        (by <xref ref="cor-tensor-with-liquid-T"/>) but not flat object of <m>\Mod_A</m>;
        in particular, <m>\ZZ \langle T \rangle</m> is a universally injective but not flat object of <m>\Mod_{\ZZ\solid}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that this failure of flatness holds even when when <m>A</m> is a strongly noetherian Huber ring, in which case the map from <m>A</m>
        to any rational localization is flat in the algebraic sense (<xref ref="bib-Huber2"/>, proof of Theorem 2.5, case II, point (II.1.iv)).
        There is no contradiction here because the two notions of flatness concern different tensor product functors.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can interpret the phenomenon being observed here as the fact that a rational localization must be distinguished from a
        <term>derived</term> rational localization, which by fiat is resolved by a Koszul complex.
        In this way, we can also interpret <xref ref="exa-local-sections-to-zero"/> as the failure of a rational localization
        (in this case <m>A \to A \langle f^{\pm} \rangle</m>) to coincide with the corresponding derived rational localization.

    <title>The adic topology and the structure presheaf</title>
    <p>
      We next introduce a presheaf of rings associated to a solid analytic rings.
      This presheaf fails to be a sheaf in general, partially echoing the corresponding failure for Huber rings; see <xref ref="subsec-sheafiness-for-Huber"/>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-solid-split-laurent-poly-ring">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any solid condensed ring <m>R</m>, the map

            R\langle T \rangle \oplus T^{-1} R\langle T^{-1} \rangle \to R\langle T^{\pm} \rangle := R \langle T,U \rangle / (TU-1)
          </me>
          is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p> 
          It suffices to treat the case <m>R = \underline{\ZZ}</m>, as we obtain the general case by taking a solid tensor product with <m>R</m> over <m>\ZZ</m>.
          We may treat that case in either <m>\Ab_\solid</m> or <m>\CAb_\solid</m> by virtue of <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>;
          we do both for the sake of illustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>\Ab_\solid</m>, evaluating <m>\underline{\ZZ}\langle T,T^{-1} \rangle</m> at <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> yields 
          the intersection of <m>\prod_I \ZZ[T,T^{-1}]</m> and <m>\prod_\ZZ \bigoplus_I \ZZ</m> within <m>\prod_\ZZ \prod_I \ZZ</m>.
          This clearly splits into the two indicated summands.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>\CAb_\solid</m>, evaluating at <m>S  = \varprojlim_i S_i \in \Prof</m> has the following effect:
          for <m>R \langle T \rangle</m> we get power series <m>\sum_n a_n T^n</m> in which the coefficients <m>a_n</m> 
          are finite sums of <m>\ZZ</m>-valued Dirac measures
          with the property that for any fixed closed-open subset <m>U</m> of <m>S</m>, 
          the integral of <m>U</m> against <m>a_n</m> is eventually zero.
          From the corresponding descriptions for <m>R\langle T^{-1} \rangle</m> and <m> R\langle T^{\pm} \rangle</m>,
          we infer the desired exact sequence.

    <title>Sheafiness for Huber rings</title>
    <p>
      We now introduce the structure presheaf of a Huber pair and study the extent to which it does or does not satisfy the sheaf property.
      This will reveal that there are two different failure modes for sheafiness of Huber rings which can be separated by working with solid analytic rings.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> a Huber pair, the <term>structure presheaf</term> <m>\calO</m> on <m>\Spa A</m>
        assigns to every rational subspace <m>U\left( \tfrac{f_1,\dots,f_n}{g} \right)</m>
        the quotient of <m>A\left\langle \tfrac{f_1}{g}, \dots, \tfrac{f_n}{g} \right\rangle^{\triangleright}</m> indicated in <xref ref="rem-rational-subspace-derived"/>.
        (It is then extended to arbitrary open subspaces by taking stalks.)
        We say <m>A</m> is <term>locally Tate</term> if <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> generates the unit ideal in <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>; this is equivalent to saying that
        <m>\Spa A</m> admits a covering by rational subspaces each of whose associated Huber ring is Tate.
        (This condition is called <term>analytic</term> in <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, but that terminology clashes with the notion of an <term>analytic ring</term> being used throughout these notes.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We say <m>A</m> is <term>sheafy</term> if <m>\calO</m> is a sheaf. This is a property of the underlying Huber ring <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>
        (which must in particular be complete).

        <p>
          The complete Tate Huber pair <m>A</m> is sheafy if and only if the associated solid analytic ring <m>\underline{A}</m> is sheafy
          and for every rational localization <m>\underline{A^{\triangleright}} \to B^{\triangleright}</m> at the level of solid analytic rings,
          <m>B^{\triangleright}</m> again represents a complete Huber ring.
        </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          For the <q>if</q> assertion, we may deduce the claim from  <xref ref="def-solid-Tate"/> in order to compare the concepts of Tate algebras (and by extension rational localizations)
          in the Huber setting and the solid setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the <q>only if</q> assertion, 
          by <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/>
          we are reduced to reduce to checking that if <m>\underline{A} \to B_1, \underline{A} \to B_2</m> are the rational localizations in a
          standard binary covering generated by <m>f,1</m> or <m>f,1-f</m>, then firstly <m>B_1, B_2</m> represent complete Huber rings,
          and secondly

            0 \to A^{\triangleright} \to B_1^{\triangleright} \oplus B_2^{\triangleright} \to B_{12}^{\triangleright} \to 0

          is an exact sequence of solid abelian groups.
          For the first assertion, we must check that if <m>f \in A^\circ</m>, 
          then the multiplication maps by <m>1-fT</m> and <m>f-T</m> in <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m> are strict inclusions;
          this can be seen by working in terms of graded rings, as in <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, Lemma 1.8.2.
          (The ultimate point is that in any univariate polynomial ring, an element cannot be a zero divisor if either its constant coefficient or its leading coefficient is a unit.)
          For the second assertion, by <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence-v1"/> we need only check exactness at the left;
          by the first assertion this equates to the corresponding exactness using Huber's rational localizations,
          which follows from <m>A</m> being sheafy.

          In the general case, we need a slightly different argument.
          We may apply <xref ref="rem-adjoin-top-nilpotent"/> to replace <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> with <m>A^{\triangleright}((q))</m>,
          but it does not formally follow that the latter is sheafy.
          Nonetheless, we may argue as in <xref ref="prop-sheafy-by-localizations-are-Huber"/>
          that every rational localization of <m>\underline{A^{\triangleright}((q))}</m>
          which is a base extension from <m>A</m> does represent a complete Huber ring;
          we may then continue as in the previous paragraph.

        A morphism <m>(Y, \calO_Y) \to (X, \calO_X)</m> of <m>\LRS</m> consists of a continuous map <m>f\colon Y \to X</m>
        together with a ring homomorphism <m>f^\sharp\colon \calO_X \to f_*\calO_Y</m> which, for each <m>y \in Y</m> mapping to <m>x \in X</m>,

        In <m>\LRS</m>, the affine scheme <m>\Spec R</m> corresponding to <m>R \in \Ring</m> has the following universal property:
        for every <m>X \in \LRS</m>, homomorphisms <m>R \to \Gamma(X, \calO_X)</m> correspond to morphisms <m>X \to \Spec R</m> via taking global sections.
        In other words, <m>\Spec</m> is right adjoint to the global sections functor <m>\LRS \to \Ring^{\op}</m>.

        Of course we can also construct other interesting objects in <m>\LRS</m>: topological manifolds, smooth (<m>C^{\infty}</m>) manifolds, real analytic manifolds,
        complex analytic manifolds, complex analytic varieties, adic spaces, etc.
        While the adjunction property of <m>\Spec</m> tells us exactly how these other objects map to affine schemes, it does not explain how they map to more general schemes.
