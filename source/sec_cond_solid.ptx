  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we introduce the solid condition on condensed abelian groups,
      and the concept of <term>solidification</term> which is a sort of universal adic completion.
      We will later show that the solid condensed abelian groups form a category equivalent to the solid abelian groups (<xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>);
      this will allow us to use the latter to reason about the former.

    <title>The finite difference operator</title>
    <p>
      We next introduce another important structure of the sequence space <m>P</m> which we use to define solid condensed abelian groups.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-finite-difference">
      <p>
        Define the sequence space <m>P := \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> as in <xref ref="def-internally-projective-object"/>.
        Consider the map <m>n \mapsto n+1</m> on <m>\NN_\infty</m> (fixing <m>\infty</m>).
        It is continuous and therefore by adjunction induces a map <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]</m>;
        the latter map preserves <m>\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> and thus induces an endomorphism <m>\sigma \colon P \to P</m>, which we call the <term>left shift</term>
        (see below for why <q>left</q> instead of <q>right</q>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Define the <q>finite difference</q> map <m>\Delta \colon P \to P</m> by <m>\Delta := \id_P - \sigma</m>.
        Via the ring homomorphism <m>\ZZ[x] \to P</m> taking <m>x^n</m> to <m>[n]</m>, this corresponds to multiplication by <m>1-x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any topological abelian group <m>M</m>, <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{M})</m> consists of null sequences (<xref ref="rem-coord-map"/>)
        and <m>\Delta^*</m> acts on these via
        <me>
          (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto (m_0-m_1, m_1-m_2, \dots)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </definition>
     <remark xml:id="rem-solid-intuition">
      <p>
        If <m>M</m> is an abelian group topologized by some nonarchimedean norm (so in particular the discrete topology is allowed), 
        then every null sequence is summable and so the action of <m>\Delta^*</m> on <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{M})</m> is inverted by the <q>telescoping</q> map
        <me>
          (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty m_n, \sum_{n=1}^\infty m_n, \dots\right)
        </me>.
        In particular, <m>\Delta^*</m> acts isomorphically on <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{M})</m>.
        We will use this observation as the basis for defining the solid property for condensed abelian groups <xref ref="def-solid-condensed"/>.
        For the moment, we observe that the property that every null sequence is uniquely summable is preserved under <em>arbitrary</em> products of topological abelian groups,
        not just countable ones.

    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-infinite-series">
      <p>
        The fact that <m>\Delta</m> is a homomorphism in <m>\CAb</m> reflects the fact that if two sequences are summable, their pointwise sum
        is summable and the sum is obtained by adding the sums of the original sequences. 
        One can similarly translate other properties of summation of infinite sequences into algebraic statements about <m>P</m>, such as the following.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A sequence of the form <m>(m,0,0,\dots)</m> is summable with sum <m>m</m>.
          This corresponds to the fact that the coefficient of <m>[0]</m> in <m>\Delta([0])</m> is <m>1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> is summable if and only if <m>(0, m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> is summable, in which case the sums coincide.
          This corresponds to the fact that <m>f_1 \circ \Delta = \Delta \circ f_2</m> where

          This corresponds to the fact that <m>f_1 \circ \Delta = \Delta \circ f_2</m> where

        We can thus use the object <m>P</m> to formulate and study an analogue of the property (of a topological abelian group)
        that every null sequence is uniquely summable, even in the presence of null sequences which cannot be distinguished from the zero
        sequence using the coordinate maps (<xref ref="rem-null-null-sequences"/>).
        We pick up this thread in <xref ref="sec_solid_to_condensed"/>.

        By analogy with the split exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to \ZZ[x] \stackrel{\times 1-x}{\to} \ZZ[x] \stackrel{Q(x) \mapsto Q(1)}{\longrightarrow} \ZZ \to 0
        </me>,
        one might expect that <m>\coker(\Delta) \cong \underline{\ZZ}</m> via the map which sends <m>[n]</m> to <m>1</m> for all <m>n \in \NN</m>.
        But this map is not continuous for the discrete topology on <m>\ZZ</m>:
        the sequence <m>\{[n]\}_n</m> is a null sequence in <m>P</m>, so it cannot map to a nonzero constant sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact <m>\coker(\Delta)</m> is a sheaf that assigns <m>S \in \Prof</m> to a certain subset of the functions <m>S \to \ZZ</m>:
        these are functions with bounded image with <em>locally closed</em> level sets.
        For example, for any closed subset <m>U \subseteq S</m> we get the function mapping <m>U</m> to 1 and <m>S \setminus U</m> to 0.
        This does not correspond to any topology on <m>\ZZ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We end up with a <em>nonsplit</em> exact sequence in <m>\CAb</m>:
        <men xml:id="eq-resolve-cofinite-Z">
          0 \to P \stackrel{\Delta}{\to} P \to \coker(\Delta) \to 0
        </men>.
        This in turn induces an exact sequence
        <men xml:id="eq-resolve-cofinite-mod-Z">
          0 \to P \stackrel{\Delta}{\to} P/\ZZ \to \coker(\Delta)/\ZZ \to 0
        </men>
        which (because <m>P/\ZZ \cong P</m>)
        is an internally projective resolution of <m>\coker(\Delta)/\ZZ</m> of length <m>1</m>.
        See <xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/> for an application of this construction.

        By the adjoint functor theorem, the embedding of <m>\CAb_\solid \to \CAb</m> admits a left adjoint.
        We denote this by <m>M \mapsto M_\solid</m> and refer to it as <term>solidification</term>.

      <p>
        Since <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/> does not include compatibility with tensor products, we instead define the <term>solid tensor product</term>

        Using <xref ref="eq-resolve-cofinite-Z"/>, we can make a number of formal observations about <xref ref="def-solid-condensed"/> and <xref ref="def-solidification-condensed"/>.
        To begin with, we may rewrite <xref ref="eq-def-of-solid-derived-version"/> as the statement that

          R\iHom_{\CAb}(\coker(\Delta), M) = 0.

      <p>
        Turning to solidification, note that <m>\Delta_\solid</m> induces an isomorphism on <m>\Hom_{\CAb_\solid}(P_\solid, M) = \Hom_{\CAb}(P,M)</m>
        for any <m>M \in \CAb_\solid</m>, so by Yoneda's lemma it is itself an isomorphism. Consequently,
        <me>
          \coker(\Delta)_\solid = \coker(\Delta_\solid) = 0
        </me>;
        since <m>\Delta_\solid</m> also induces an isomorphism on <m>\Ext^i_{\CAb_\solid}(P_\solid, M) = \Ext^i_{\CAb}(P,M)</m>
        for any <m>i \gt 0</m>, the derived solidification of <m>\coker(\Delta)</m> also vanishes.

        </me>
        we obtain the example <m>\coker(\Delta)/\underline{\ZZ}</m> whose solidification is zero, but whose derived solidification consists of <m>\ZZ</m> in degree <m>-1</m>.
        For <m>M \in \CAb</m> general, we obtain a canonical morphism

        We say that an object <m>C</m> in the derived category <m>D(\CAb)</m> is <term>solid</term> if its cohomology groups belong to <m>\CAb_\solid</m>.
        It is equivalent (thanks to <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>) to require

          \Delta^*\colon R\iHom_{\CAb}(P, C) \to R\iHom_{\CAb}(P,C)

        The forgetful functor from the full subcategory of solid objects of <m>D(\CAb)</m> back to <m>D(\CAb)</m> again has a left adjoint, called <term>derived solidification</term>.

      <p>
        Even when we start with a map <m>M \to N</m> in <m>\CAb</m>, there is a difference between saying that this map induces an isomorphism of solidifications

    <title>Solidification and the real numbers</title>
    <p>
      As the definition of a solid condensed abelian group is meant to simulate the condition that null sequences are summable,
      it is perhaps not surprising that it raises havoc in an archimedean context.
      We record some results both to illustrate the incompatibility between solidification and the topology of the reals,
      but also to provide a technique that will be used in the course of comparing solid abelian groups with their condensed counterparts
      (see <xref ref="cor-replace-prod-with-bounded-solid"/>).
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-R-solid-is-zero">
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have <m>\underline{\RR}_\solid = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The null sequence <m>\{2^{-\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor}\}_n</m> in <m>\RR</m>, i.e.,
          <men xml:id="eq-not-summable-null-sequence">
            1, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \dots
          </men>
          defines an element <m>x \in \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\RR})</m>; we may thus apply the inverse of <m>\Delta^*</m> to get an element
          <m>y \in \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\RR}_\solid)</m>. Taking the first coordinate (i.e., restricting along <m>\ZZ \to \ZZ \cdot [1] \subset P</m>)
          yields an element <m>z \in \underline{\RR}_\solid(*)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By formally rearranging <xref ref="eq-not-summable-null-sequence"/> as
          <me>
            1 + \left( \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{1}{4} \right) + \cdots
          </me>
          and invoking <xref ref="rem-infinite-series"/>, we deduce that <m>z = 1 + z</m>. We deduce that <m>0 = 1</m> in <m>\underline{\RR}_\solid(*)</m>; since
          <m>\underline{\RR}_\solid</m> is a ring object in <m>\CAb</m> (because <m>\underline{\RR}</m> is), it follows that <m>\underline{\RR}_\solid = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-solid-R-module-is-zero">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>M \in \CAb</m> admits an <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure, then <m>M_\solid = 0</m>.
          (This will also hold at the derived level; see <xref ref="cor-solid-R-module-is-zero-monomorphism"/>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure on <m>M</m> formally promotes to an <m>\underline{\RR}_\solid</m>-module structure on <m>M_\solid</m>,
          but then <xref ref="prop-R-solid-is-zero"/> implies that <m>M_\solid</m> is a module over the zero ring.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-solid-R-module-is-zero-monomorphism">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M \to N</m> be a monomorphism in <m>\CAb</m> such that <m>N/M</m> admits an <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure
          (e.g., if <m>N</m> itself admits an <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure we may take <m>M=0</m>).
          Then <m>M_\solid \cong N_\solid</m>; 
          in addition, for each <m>i \gt 0</m>, the morphism of functors <m>\iExt^i_{\CAb}(N, \bullet) \to \iExt^i_{\CAb}(M, \bullet)</m> on <m>\CAb_\solid</m>
          is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For each <m>i \gt 0</m>, for any <m>Q \in \CAb_\solid</m>, <m>\iExt^i_{\CAb}(N/M, Q)</m> is solid by <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>
          and inherits an <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure from <m>N/M</m>, hence is zero.
          This implies the second assertion, including the case <m>i = 0</m> from which we recover the first assertion using Yoneda's lemma.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark>
      <p>
        By analogy with <xref ref="rem-express-solidification-using-cof"/>, we can apply <xref ref="prop-R-solid-is-zero"/>
        to see that the derived solidification of <m>\underline{\RR}/\underline{\ZZ}</m> consists of <m>\underline{\ZZ}</m>
        placed in degree <m>-1</m>.

        <xref ref="prop-R-solid-is-zero"/> and its corollaries also apply with <m>\underline{\RR}</m> replaced by <m>\underline{\QQ}</m> equipped with the archimedean topology.
        By contrast, for the <m>p</m>-adic topology for some prime <m>p</m>, the solidification of <m>\underline{\QQ}</m> will end up being precisely <m>\underline{\QQ_p}</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="prop-R-solid-is-zero"/> and its corollaries make clear that if we want any hope of doing analytic geometry over <m>\RR</m> or <m>\CC</m>,
        we cannot stick to solid abelian groups and must instead find a more flexible framework. We will eventually introduce such a framework in the form of
        <term>analytic rings</term>, where we define a class of <q>complete modules</q> with properties analogous to those of solid abelian groups
        (<xref ref="sec_analytic"/>).

    <title>Solid abelian groups as condensed abelian groups</title>
    <p>
      At this point, we can exhibit a functor from solid <m>\ZZ</m>-modules to solid objects in <m>\CAb</m>.
      We will prove later that this yields an equivalence (<xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>).
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-compare-hom-solid-con">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <m>\CAb</m>, for any at most countable index sets <m>I,J</m>, we have
          <me>
            \Hom_{\CAb}\left(\prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \prod_J \underline{\ZZ}\right) = \prod_J \bigoplus_I \ZZ
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since both objects are represented by sequential topological abelian groups, we may make the computation there,
          but we have already done this in <xref ref="rem-compare-solid-to-top-ab-group"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <proposition xml:id="thm-solid-to-condensed">
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is a functor <m>\Ab_\solid \to \CAb_\solid</m> carrying <m>\ZZ_\solid</m> to <m>\underline{\ZZ}</m> and compatible with
          all limits (notably countable products), colimits, <m>\Hom</m>, <m>\iHom</m>, and <m>\otimes_\solid</m>.
          (Full faithfulness and compatibility with <m>\Ext</m> and <m>\iExt</m> require an extra step; see <xref ref="cor-solid-embedding-exact"/>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/> and <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>, we have <m>\prod_I \underline{\ZZ} \in \CAb_\solid</m>
          whenever <m>I</m> is at most countable.
          By <xref ref="lem-compare-hom-solid-con"/>, we get a fully faithful functor <m>\ZZ_\solid \to \CAb_\solid</m> carrying <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> to <m>\prod_I \underline{\ZZ}</m>.
          Since <m>\prod_\NN \ZZ_\solid</m> is a compact generator of <m>\Ab_\solid</m>, we get the functor we want by forming a left Kan extension.

      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We note in passing that <xref ref="thm-solid-to-condensed"/> admits the following compatibility with solidification:
        applying the functor <m>\Ab \to \Ab_\solid</m> and then passing to <m>\CAb</m> gives the same result as 
        passing from <m>\Ab</m> to <m>\CAb</m> (i.e., passing to discrete topological groups). In both cases the essential image is contained in <m>\CAb_\solid</m>.
