    <title>Cohomology</title>
    <p>
      We insert a remark here which we will build upon later.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>X \in \CSet, M \in \Ab</m>, define <m>H^i(X, M) := \Ext^i_{\CAb}(\ZZ[X], M)</m> viewing <m>M</m> as a discrete object in <m>\CAb</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        For <m>X \in \Top</m> a CW complex, <m>H^i(X, M)</m> is canonically identified with <m>H^i_{\sing}(X, M)</m>,
        the singular cohomology with coefficients in <m>M</m>.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is a form of the Dold<ndash/>Thom theorem;
          see <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-notes"/>, Lecture 3 (but this is written with <m>\kappa</m> large).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <remark xml:id="rem-profinite-projective">
      <p>
        Let <m>Z \to Y</m> be a surjection (in the sense of topological spaces) in <m>\Prof</m>.
        Per <xref ref="rem-change-pro-system-to-sequential"/>, we may write <m>Y</m> and <m>Z</m> as sequential inverse limits of finite sets:
        <m>Y = \varprojlim_{n \in \NN} Y_n</m>, <m>Z = \varprojlim_{n \in \NN} Z_n</m>.
        By renumbering as needed, we may express the surjection <m>Z \to Y</m> as a coherent sequence of surjective maps <m>Z_n \to Y_n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="rem-Stone-duality"/>, we can ensure than the transition maps in each system are surjective.
        However, we can actually do better: we can enforce that the maps
        <me>
          Z_{n+1} \to Z_n \times_{Y_n} Y_{n+1}
        </me>
        are surjective. To see this, we interpret <m>Y_n</m> and <m>Z_n</m> as coverings of <m>Y</m> and <m>Z</m>, respectively,
        by finite disjoint unions of closed-open subsets. We can then choose <m>Z_{n+1}</m> (and everything above it) so that as a covering, it
        refines not only <m>Z_n</m> but also the pullback cover from <m>Y_{n+1}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this, it is easy to see that any object of <m>\Prof</m> is projective: that is, given any <m>X \in \Prof</m>
        and any surjection <m>Z \to Y</m> in <m>\Prof</m>, any morphism <m>X \to Y</m> can be lifted through <m>Z</m>.
        In particular, any surjection <m>Y \to X</m> in <m>\Prof</m> admits a section; this is quite a special feature of the category
        (for instance it is totally false in <m>\CHaus</m>).
      </p>
      <p>
        It formally follows that any object of <m>\Prof</m> is also projective in <m>\CSet</m>.
        To wit, for <m>X \in \Prof</m> and <m>T \to S</m> a surjection in <m>\CSet</m>, the map <m>T(X) \to S(X)</m> is <em>a priori</em> not surjective,
        but we do know that every element of <m>S(X)</m> lifts to <m>T(Y)</m> for some surjection <m>Y \to X</m> in <m>\Prof</m> depending on the original element.
        
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark xml:id="rem-minimal-covers-of-Ninfty">
      <p>
        We record an important special property of the space <m>\NN_\infty</m> used in <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>:
        given any surjection <m>S \to \NN_\infty</m> in <m>\Prof</m>, we can construct a closed subspace <m>S'</m> of <m>S</m>
        such that the composition <m>S' \to S \to \NN_\infty</m> is surjective and also bijective over <m>\NN</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, we take <m>S'</m> to be the union of the whole fiber over <m>\infty</m> plus a single lift of each <m>n \in \NN</m>.
        To see that this is closed in <m>S</m>, we check that the complement is open: each fiber of <m>S</m> over <m>n \in \NN</m> is itself open
        by continuity of <m>S \to \NN_\infty</m>, and the complement of a single point in this fiber is also open.

    <title>Six functors formalism for quasicoherent sheaves</title>
    <p>
      One takeaway from <xref ref="exa-base-extension-not-flat"/> is that we cannot rely on flatness of localization if we want to
      pass from solid modules to an associated theory of solid quasicoherent sheaves on schemes.
      This means that we have to give up on working exclusively with the category of solid modules and instead pass to its associated derived category.
      This is perhaps not surprising in light of the fact that we built some duality into the definition of solid modules,
      and duality is invariably a property about derived categories of modules anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, there is already a similar issue with working with quasicoherent sheaves in scheme theory!
      if <m>f\colon Y \to X</m> is a morphism of schemes and <m>\calF</m> is a quasicoherent sheaf on <m>Y</m>, then we cannot
      guarantee that the direct image sheaf <m>f_* \calF</m> is actually quasicoherent unless the map <m>f</m> is <term>qcqs</term>,
      short for <term>quasicompact and quasiseparated</term> (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, Tag 01LC).
      OTherwise, one is forced to take an infinite product of quasicoherent sheaves and this is not quasicoherent because
      <me>
        \left( \prod_i M_i \right) \otimes_R R[1/f] \neq \prod_i (M_i \otimes_R R[1/f]).
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      One can resolve both issues at once by working with the derived category of solid quasicoherent sheaves.
      In fact, in this context one can build a <term>six functors formalism</term> for quasicoherent sheaves
      analogous to what we are used to in etale cohomology!
      We will not focus on this right now, but it should become clear how to do this by the end of the course.

  <subsection>
    <title>Setting up a comparison of solidifications</title>
    <p>
      Since we already know from <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/> and <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>
      that <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ} \in \CAb_\solid</m>,
      the key remaining point in constructing a functor <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_\solid} \to \CAb_\solid</m> is to match up endomorphisms into and especially
      out of infinite products of <m>\ZZ_{\solid}</m> versus <m>\underline{\ZZ}</m>.
      We study these in <m>\CAb</m> using the object <m>P</m> over which we have already established some control;
      in the process, we will also identify its solidification.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For each <m>n \in \NN</m>, we define the <m>n</m>-th coordinate map <m>c_n\colon P \to \underline{\ZZ}</m>.
        This is induced by the map <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \to \underline{\ZZ}</m> corresponding to the map <m>\NN_\infty \to \ZZ</m> in <m>\Prof</m>
        carrying <m>n</m> to 1 and all other elements to 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        The product of the maps <m>c_n</m> defines the full coordinate map <m>c \colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>,
        where the product is taken in <m>\CAb</m>. We may think of this product more concretely by first forming it in <m>\Top</m> and then applying the functor <m>\Top \to \CSet</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-compare-homs-out-of-product-solid">
      <p>
        In order to match up <m>\prod_\NN \ZZ_\solid \in \Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m> with <m>\prod_n \underline{\ZZ} \in \CAb_\solid</m>, we need to know that
        <me>
          \Hom_{\CAb}\left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \right) = \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ.
        </me>
        There is an obvious map from right to left: each generator of the direct sum corresponds to the projection onto a single coordinate.
        However, we also obtain a map in the other direction by restricting along the coordinate map <m>c\colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>
        (<xref ref="rem-coord-map"/>) and then interpreting <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\ZZ})</m> as the 
        null sequences in <m>\ZZ</m>, which is the same thing as the direct sum because <m>\ZZ</m> carries the discrete topology.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear that the composition from right to left to right is an isomorphism, but not so in the other direction:
        we do not have any formal control of morphisms out of a product in <m>\CAb</m> like we built into the construction of <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_{\solid}}</m>.
        To study the composition, we insert an additional term between <m>P</m> and <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> and use two different arguments
        to take the two steps across this intermediate term.
        This will amount to showing that <m>P</m> is <q>dense</q> in <m>\bigoplus_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>, 
        or in more precise terms, the map <m>c_\solid\colon P_\solid \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> is an isomorphism (<xref ref="cor-solidification-of-P"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Note that <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> admits the subobject
        <me>
          \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} := \colim_{n \in \NN} \prod_\NN \underline{\{-n,\dots,n\}}.
        </me>
        In terms of evaluations at <m>S \in \Prof</m>, <m>\left(\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}\right)(S)</m> consists of continuous maps <m>S \to \prod_\NN \ZZ</m>,
        or equivalently families of continuous maps <m>S \to \ZZ</m> indexed by <m>\NN</m>. Each of these maps has bounded image, but
        <m>\left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right)(S)</m> picks out the families with <em>uniformly</em> bounded image.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the explicit description of <m>\ZZ[\NN_\infty]</m> (<xref ref="exa-module-ring-topological-space"/>),
        we can factor <m>c\colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> through <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m> to yield a sequence of inclusions
        <men xml:id="eq-p-to-product">
          P \stackrel{c}{\to} \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}.
        </men>
        Namely, <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}) = \prod_\NN \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\ZZ})</m> consists of infinite families of null sequences in <m>\ZZ</m>,
        while <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ})</m> picks out those families whose images are uniformly bounded.
        The sequences corresponding to the factors of the map <m>c</m> only take values in <m>\{0,1\}</m>, so they form a family of the latter form.

    <title>A comparison of solidifications</title>
    <p>
      We now compare the effect of solidification across the terms of <xref ref="eq-p-to-product"/>.
      For the first step, the strategy is to build a diagram that allows us to exploit the fact that <m>\Delta\colon P \to P</m>
      becomes an isomorphism after solidification.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-diagram-for-Delta">
      <p>
        Let <m>\Delta\colon \ZZ[\NN] \to \ZZ[\NN]</m> denote the map <m>[n] \mapsto [n]-[n+1]</m>.
        We then obtain a commutative diagram
        <figure>
          <image>
            <latex-image>
              \xymatrix{
               \ZZ[\NN] \otimes \ZZ[\NN] \ar[r] \ar^{\Delta \otimes \id}[d]  &amp;\ZZ[\NN] \ar@{=}[d] \\
               \ZZ[\NN] \otimes \ZZ[\NN] \ar[r] &amp; \ZZ[\NN]
              }
            </latex-image>
          </image>
        </figure>
      of discrete abelian groups in which the top row arrow maps <m>[m] \otimes [n]</m> to <m>[n]</m> if <m>m = n</m> and 0 otherwise,
      and the bottom row maps <m>[m] \otimes [n]</m> to <m>[n]</m> if <m>m \leq n</m> and 0 otherwise.
      Note that the two rows are equalized by <m>\ZZ[\NN] \to \ZZ[\NN] \otimes \ZZ[\NN]</m> via <m>[n] \mapsto [n] \otimes [n]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This promotes to a commutative diagram
        <figure>
          <image>
            <latex-image>
              \xymatrix{

            </latex-image>
          </image>
        </figure>
        where again the rows are equalized by a map <m>P \to P \otimes P</m> acting via <m>[n] \mapsto [n] \otimes [n]</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-diagram-p-to-bd">

      <proof>
        <p>
          By tensoring the second diagram from <xref ref="def-diagram-for-Delta"/> on the right along <m>c</m>, 
          we get a diagram of the form we want except with <m>P</m> replaced by <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m>.
          To get what we want, all that remains is to verify that the resulting top row
          <men xml:id="eq-Delta-top-row">
            P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}
          </men>
          factors through <m>c</m>; the splitting of the resulting top row will be guaranteed by the fact that since <m>c</m> is injective,  
           the composition <m>P \to P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to P</m> will again be the identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          By Hom-tensor adjunction, we reinterpret <xref ref="eq-Delta-top-row"/> as an element of <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \iHom_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ},\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}\right) </m>
          and in turn by <xref ref="rem-coord-map"/> as a null sequence in <m>\iHom_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ},\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}\right)</m>;
          the claim is that this sequence belongs to the image of
          <me> 
            \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \iHom_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ},P \right)

        </p>
        <p>
          The sequence in question is the one whose <m>n</m>-th term is the <m>n</m>-th projection <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to \underline{\ZZ}</m> followed
          by the <m>n</m>-th injection <m>\underline{\ZZ} \to \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m>. The latter is the image of <m>[n] \in P</m> under <m>c</m>, proving the claim.

          where now both rows are split injections.
          By applying Hom-tensor adjunction to write

            \iExt_{\CAb}^i\left( P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N\right) = \iExt^i_{\CAb}\left( P, \iHom_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N\right)\right)
          </me>
          and invoking <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/> to see that <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N)</m> is solid, we deduce that the
          right column is an isomorphism.
          Consequently, the upper composition is an injection, so we have an injection

            \iExt^i_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N\right) \stackrel{c^*}{\to} \iExt^i_{\CAb}\left(P, N\right) = 0

        </p>
        <p>
          For the first assertion, we solidify the diagram in <xref ref="lem-diagram-p-to-bd"/> to obtain

          where now the bottom row is a split surjection. By considering the previous diagram with <m>i=0</m>, we see that the left column
          induces an isomorphism of representable functors and hence is an isomorphism by Yoneda's lemma.
          At this point we conclude that <m>c_\solid</m> is a split surjection; however, since the top row is also surjective,
          tracing clockwise from <m>\left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right)_\solid</m> back to <m>P_\solid</m> yields a surjection whose postcomposition
          with <m>c_\solid</m> is the identity map. This proves that <m>c_\solid</m> is also injective.

          By analogy with the construction of <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m>, we define
          <me>
            \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\RR} := \colim_{n \in \NN} \prod_\NN \underline{[-n,n]};
          </me>
          we will construct an isomorphism
          <me>
            \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}\right) / \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right) \cong \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\RR} \right) / \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\RR} \right).
          </me>
          Since the right-hand side carries an evident <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure, so does the left-hand side. 
          By <xref ref="cor-solid-R-module-is-zero-monomorphism"/>, this will yield the claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed isomorphism is formally equivalent to the claim that
          <me>
            \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\RR} \right) / \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right) \cong \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\RR} \right) / \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ} \right);
          </me>
          this holds because <m>\RR/\ZZ</m> is compact.

          (Note that the target is solid by <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/> and <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>.)
          Moreover, for each <m>i \gt 0</m>, <m>\iExt^i_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}, N\right) = 0</m> for all <m>N \in \CAb_{\solid}</m>.

    <title>A characterization of solid condensed abelian groups</title>
    <p>
      It still remains to identify the essential image of the functor from solid <m>\ZZ</m>-modules.
      In one direction, it is easy to see that we get solid objects in <m>\CAb</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-solid-to-solid">
      <statement>
        The image of any <m>M \in \Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m> in <m>\CAb</m> is solid.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        For <m>M = \prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> this follows from <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/> and <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>.

      <p>
        For <m>S \in \Prof</m> infinite, we construct a morphism <m>g\colon P \to \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> as follows.
        Per <xref ref="rem-change-pro-system-to-sequential"/>, we may write <m>S</m> as a sequential inverse limit of finite sets with surjective transition maps:
        <m>S = \varprojlim_{n \in \NN} S_n</m>.
        We inductively choose subsets <m>T_n \subset S_n</m> and maps <m>i_n: T_n \to S</m> subject to the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each composition <m>T_n \stackrel{i_n}{\to} S \to S_n</m> coincides with the inclusion <m>T_n \subseteq S_n</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each <m>T_n</m> is the complement of the images of the maps <m>T_m \stackrel{i_m}{\to} S \to S_n</m> for all <m>m \lt n</m>.
            In particular, <m>T_1 = S_1</m>.

        </ul>
        Choose a bijection <m>\NN \cong T_1 \sqcup T_2 \sqcup \cdots</m>.
        We then define the map <m>g\colon P \to \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> by mapping each <m>T_n</m> via <m>i_m</m> minus the map given by taking <m>T_n \to S_{n-1}</m>
        and then collating the maps <m>i_m</m> for <m>m \lt n</m>. (That is, each element of <m>S_{n-1}</m> projects to <m>T_m</m> for a unique choice of <m>m</m>,

          obtained by starting with the identity and successively subtracting off the compositions <m>S \to S_n \to S</m>
          (where the second map is the collated map from earlier).
          Then we argue as in <xref ref="lem-diagram-p-to-bd"/> to show that the lower composition factors through <m>g</m>;
          the left column becomes an isomorphism after solidifying; and tracing a loop clockwise from <m>P_\solid</m> in the solidified diagram yields an isomorphism.

        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-solid-to-solid"/>, any object in the essential image is solid.

          <m>\CAb_\solid</m> admits <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> as a single compact generator,

    <remark>

        <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/> has the effect that we can replace the study of <m>\CAb_\solid</m>
        with the equivalent but conceptually simpler category <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m>, whose definition contains no topology.
        One can also go in the opposite direction, as in the following.

    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes-condensed">
      <p>
        We give an alternate proof of <xref ref="lem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes"/> in the setting of condensed abelian groups.
        In this language, the statement is that for <m>Q</m> a torsion <m>\ZZ</m>-module,
        <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(\underline{\QQ}, \underline{ZZ}) = 0</m>. To prove this, evaluate at <m>S \in \Prof</m>:
        <me>
          \iHom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})(S) = \Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\ZZ})
          = \Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q}, \iHom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\ZZ})).
        </me>
        In this expression, <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\ZZ})</m> is represented by the locally compact topological abelian group
        consisting of the continuous (i.e., locally constant) functions <m>S \to \ZZ</m>, and we can interpret the outer <m>\Hom</m> in the category of topological abelian groups.
        But even at the level of underlying abelian groups this Hom is zero because <m>Q</m> cannot admit a nonzero map to any torsion-free abelian group.

      Since we already know from <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/> and <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>
      that <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ} \in \CAb_\solid</m>,
      the key remaining point in constructing a functor <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_\solid} \to \CAb_\solid</m> is to match up endomorphisms into and especially
      out of infinite products of <m>\ZZ_{\solid}</m> versus <m>\underline{\ZZ}</m>.
      We study these in <m>\CAb</m> using the object <m>P</m> over which we have already established some control;
      in the process, we will also identify its solidification.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-compare-homs-out-of-product-solid">

        In order to match up <m>\prod_\NN \ZZ_\solid \in \Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m> with <m>\prod_n \underline{\ZZ} \in \CAb_\solid</m>, we need to know that
        <me>
          \Hom_{\CAb}\left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{\ZZ} \right) = \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ.
        </me>
        There is an obvious map from right to left: each generator of the direct sum corresponds to the projection onto a single coordinate.
        However, we also obtain a map in the other direction by restricting along the coordinate map <m>c\colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>
        (<xref ref="rem-coord-map"/>) and then interpreting <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\ZZ})</m> as the 
        null sequences in <m>\ZZ</m>, which is the same thing as the direct sum because <m>\ZZ</m> carries the discrete topology.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear that the composition from right to left to right is an isomorphism, but not so in the other direction:
        we do not have any formal control of morphisms out of a product in <m>\CAb</m> like we built into the construction of <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_{\solid}}</m>.
        To study the composition, we insert an additional term between <m>P</m> and <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> and use two different arguments
        to take the two steps across this intermediate term.
        This will amount to showing that <m>P</m> is <q>dense</q> in <m>\bigoplus_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>, 
        or in more precise terms, the map <m>c_\solid\colon P_\solid \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> is an isomorphism (<xref ref="cor-solidification-of-P"/>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that both <m>P</m> and <m>\bigoplus_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> are sequential topological abelian groups,
        so we can interpret <m>c</m> as an inclusion in that category instead. The same will be true of the intermediate object we
        insert between them in <xref ref="def-strict-factorization"/>.

      Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to compare <m>P</m> with <m>\prod_\NN \ZZ_\solid</m>

          The map <m>A_0^{\triangleright} \to A^{\triangleright}</m> induces a surjection <m>(A_0^{\triangleright})_{\liquid q} \to A^{\triangleright}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Per <xref ref="eq-universal-liquefaction"/>, it suffices to check that for <m>k \gt 0</m> and <m>c \gt 0</m>, an arbitrary series 
          <m>s = \sum_{m \in \NN} s_{m} q^m</m> with <m>|s_{m}| \leq c(m+1)^k</m> for all <m>m</m> belongs to the image of <m>(A_0^{\triangleright})_{\liquid q}</m>.
          We proceed by induction on <m>k</m>. In the base case <m>k=0</m>,
          <me>
            s = \sum_{m=0}^\infty (s_{2m} q^m + s_{2m+1}q^{m+1}) q^m
          </me>
          and the coefficients of <m>q^m</m> form a null sequence in <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m>.
          For the induction step, define <m>t_{i,j}</m> according to <xref ref="lem-separate-sum-by-order-of-k"/> and
          set <m>t_i := \sum_{j=0}^\infty t_{i,j} q^j</m>, so that
          <me>
            s = \sum_{i=0}^\infty t_i q^i
          </me>;
          then each <m>t_i</m> belongs to <m>(A_0^{\triangleright})_{\liquid q}</m> by the induction hypothesis,
          but the <m>t_i</m> do not form a null sequence.
          However, as in the base case we may rewrite this sum as
          <me>
            s = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (t_{2i} q^i + t_{2m+1}q^{i+1}) q^i

        taking <m>\sum_i a_i T^i</m> to <m>\max_i \{|a_i|\}</m>. This is again submultiplicative; if <m>|\bullet|</m> is multiplicative, then the Gauss seminorm is also multiplicative
        (this amounts to a version of Gauss's lemma on factorization of integer polynomials, hence the terminology).

        More evidently, if <m>\rho \gt 0</m> and we start with a norm on <m>R</m>, then the <m>\rho</m>-Gauss seminorm on <m>R[T]</m> is a norm, so we also refer to it as the

        <p>
          Our goal is to verify that <m>|xy|_\rho = |x|_\rho|y|_\rho</m> for all <m>x,y \in R[T]</m>; there is nothing to check unless <m>|x|_\rho, |y|_\rho \gt 0</m>.
          In that case, if we write <m>x = \sum_i x_i T^i</m>, <m>y = \sum_j x_j T^j</m>, then there is a maximal index <m>i_0</m> for which <m>|x_{i_0}| \rho^{i_0} = |x|_\rho</m>
          and a maximal index <m>j_0</m> for which <m>|y_{j_0}| \rho^{j_0} = |y|_\rho</m>. 
          Now set <m>k := i_0 + j_0</m> and write the coefficient of <m>T^{i_0+j_0}</m> in <m>xy</m> as the sum of <m>x_i y_j</m> over all pairs of nonnegative integers <m>i,j</m>
          with <m>i+j=k</m>.

              If <m>i \gt i_0</m>, then <m>|x_i| \rho^i \lt |x|_\rho</m>, <m>|y_j| \rho^j \leq |y|_\rho</m>

              This leaves only the case <m>i=i_0, j = j_0</m>, in which case <m>|x_i| \rho^i = |x|_\rho</m>, <m>|y_j| \rho^j = |y|_\rho</m>

        If <m>A</m> is not sheafy, then <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence"/> remains valid as a statement in the derived category of <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>
        if we give all of the terms their natural derived structure per <xref ref="rem-rational-subspace-derived"/>,
        which is to say we view the other rings in the sequence as animated condensed rings.

        When this presheaf is a sheaf, we may view <m>\Spa A</m> as a locally ringed space,

        A corresponding issue in the context of solid analytic rings is that the quotient by the ideal <m>(f_1- gT_1, \dots, f_n - gT_n)</m> may not equal the

          The first point is that if <m>A \to B \to C</m> is a sequence of rational localizations,

          We need to show that this implies that the original complex can also be so represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our original complex, when truncated up to degree <m>-1</m> or down to degree <m>1</m>,
          becomes a complex that base extends to zero, and so by <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> is isomorphic to the zero complex.
          We may thus reduce to the case where we start with a single module <m>\underline{M} \in \Mod_{\underline{A}}</m> placed in degree <m>0</m> whose base extensions are 
          represented by finite projective modules placed in degree <m>0</m>, and we wish to deduce that
          <m>\underline{M}</m> is itself represented by a finite projective <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module. 
          Beware that we do not yet know that <m>\underline{M}</m> is represented by an <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module <m>M</m>; we will only infer this in the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we know that <m>\underline{M} \otimes_{\underline{A}}^L \underline{A_i}^{\triangleright}</m> is concentrated in degree <m>0</m>, we have an exact sequence
          <men xml:id="eq-M-exact-sequence">
            0 \to \underline{M} \to \underline{M} \otimes_{\underline{A}} \underline{A_1}^{\triangleright} \oplus \underline{M} \otimes_{\underline{A}} \underline{A_2}^{\triangleright} \to M \otimes_{\underline{A}} \underline{A_{12}}^{\triangleright} \to 0
          </men>
          in which every term other than <m>\underline{M}</m> is represented by a topological <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module 
          (namely a finite projective module over some <m>A_i^{\triangleright}</m>).
          The same then follows for <m>\underline{M}</m> because kernels of topological groups are preserved by the passage to condensed groups;
          that is, we now can interpret <m>\underline{M}</m> as being represented by a topological <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module <m>M</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next verify that we can choose a morphism <m>F \to M</m> from a finite free <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module <m>F</m>
          which induces a surjection 
          <m>\underline{F} \otimes_{\underline{A}} \underline{A_i}^{\triangleright} \to \underline{M} \otimes_{\underline{A}} \underline{A_i}^{\triangleright}</m> 
          for <m>i=1,2</m>;
          this would be automatic if the tensor products in <xref ref="eq-M-exact-sequence"/> were purely algebraic, but as it stands some argument is needed.
          Since we are now talking about Huber rings rather than condensed rings, we can at least say that the algebraic tensor product 
          <m>M \otimes_{A^{\triangleright}} A_i^{\triangleright}</m>
          has dense image in the underlying topological module of <m>\underline{M} \otimes_{\underline{A}} \underline{A}_i^{\triangleright}</m>.
          We may thus deduce the existence of the desired morphism from <xref ref="lem-approximate-basis"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we now view <m>\underline{F} \to \underline{M}</m> as a two-term complex in <m>\calD(\Mod_{\underline{A}})</m> with <m>\underline{M}</m> placed in degree <m>0</m>,
          its base extension to <m>\calD(\Mod_{\underline{A_i}})</m> has vanishing cohomology in degree <m>0</m>.
          By <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> again, <m>\underline{F} \to \underline{M}</m> itself has vanishing cohomology in degree <m>0</m>, 
          meaning that <m>\underline{F} \to \underline{M}</m> is surjective in <m>\Mod_{\underline{A}}</m>.
          This in turn implies that <m>F \to M</m> is surjective, so <m>M</m> is a finitely generated <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> again, for any <m>N \in \Mod_{\underline{A}}</m>, <m>\iExt^1_{\underline{A}}(\underline{M}, N) = 0</m>;
          consequently, <m>\underline{M}</m> is projective in <m>\Mod_{\underline{A}}</m>.
          While this does not itself imply that <m>M</m> is projective as an <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module,
          we do have a surjection <m>\underline{F} \to \underline{M}</m> in <m>\Mod_{\underline{A}}</m> which we can now split;
          this implies that <m>F \to M</m> is split, and hence that <m>M</m> is a projective <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module.
        </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-approximate-basis">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a complete Huber ring. Let <m>M</m> be a finite projective <m>A</m>-module, topologized as a quotient of some finite free <m>A</m>-module
          (note that this topology is independent of the choice). Let <m>S</m> be a subset of <m>M</m> whose accumulation points include a set of <m>A</m>-module generators of <m>M</m>.
          Then <m>S</m> generates <m>M</m> as an <m>A</m>-module; in particular, it contains a finite subset which generates <m>M</m> as an <m>A</m>-module.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>M</m> is a finite projective <m>A</m>-module, we can write it as a summand of a finite free module <m>F \cong M \oplus M'</m>.
          By adding to <m>S</m> a finite set of <m>A</m>-module generators of <m>M'</m>, we may reduce to the case <m>M = F</m>.

        <p>
          We thus assume hereafter that <m>M</m> is free on the basis <m>e_1,\dots,e_n</m>. By hypothesis, we can choose elements <m>e'_1,\dots,e'_n \in S</m>
          such that the <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>B</m> with <m>e'_j = \sum_i B_{ij} e_i</m> has the property that <m>1-B</m> has entries in <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m>.
          Consequently, <m>1-\det(B) \in A^{\circ \circ}</m> and so <m>B</m> is invertible; this proves the claim.

        <p>
          As in the proof of <xref ref="cor-vector-bundles"/>, we translate this into the statement that if we start with a complex <m>\underline{M}</m> in <m>\calD(\Mod_{\underline{A}})</m>
          whose base extensions to <m>\calD(\Mod_{\underline{A}_i})</m> are represented by bounded-above complexes of finite projective <m>A_i^{\triangleright}</m>-modules,
          then <m>\underline{M}</m> is represented by a bounded-above complex of finite projective <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-modules.
          This condition means that some lower truncation of the original complex base extends to zero,
          and so by <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> is isomorphic to zero; we may thus reduce to the case where our original complex is itself bounded above.

          Suppose the largest degree that occurs is <m>n</m>.
          By arguing as in the proof of <xref ref="cor-vector-bundles"/>, we obtain a finite free <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module <m>F</m>
          and a morphism <m>\underline{F}[n] \to \underline{M}</m> which induces a surjection of cohomology in degree <m>n</m>.
          By forming a mapping cone, we obtain a representation of <m>\underline{M}</m> by a complex with <m>\underline{F}</m> placed in degree <m>n</m>
          and zero terms in higher degrees. By applying the same argument to the mapping cone and iterating,
          we build a representation of <m>\underline{M}</m> with terms represented by finite projective <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-modules placed in all degrees <m>\leq n</m>
          and zero terms in higher degrees.

          We first upgrade 
          <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering"/> to an <m>\infty</m>-categorical analogue by exhibiting an equivalence
          <men xml:id="eq-glueing-equivalence-qcoh">

          </men>.
          Namely, in the proof of <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering"/> we <q>explicitly</q> checked that the unit and counit are isomorphisms,
          in that our description yields explicit (and functorial) inverse morphisms and chain homotopy equivalences of the compositions with the identity morphisms.
          We can thus formally deduce the conclusion from <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/>.
        </p>
      <p>
        For any morphism <m>A \to C</m>, <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes_A^L C^{\triangleright}</m>
        is the derived derived <m>f</m>-completion of <m>C^{\triangleright}</m>. It thus suffices to check that this completion is equal to the naive derived <m>f</m>-completion.
        For this, as suggested in <xref ref="rem-sum-null-against-f"/>,
        we may proceed in two steps. We first force <m>f</m> to become topologically nilpotent by passing from <m>C</m> to <m>(\ZZ[\hat{q}] \otimes C)/(q-f)</m>;
        this quotient equals the derived quotient because <m>q-f</m> is not a zero divisor in <m>\ZZ[\hat{q}] \otimes C^{\triangleright}</m>.
        (The sections over <m>S \in \Prof</m> are obtained by sheafifying <m>P(S) \otimes C^{\triangleright}(S) \subseteq \prod_{s \in S} C^{\triangleright}(*)[q]</m>,
        where it is visible that multiplication by the monic polynomial <m>q-f</m> is injective.)
        We then liquefy with respect to <m>f</m>, which as usual is an underived operation on rings (<xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/>).

      We compare the previous discussion with the following definition in algebraic geometry.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-absolutely-flat-rings">

        A morphism <m>A \to B</m> in <m>\Ring</m> is <term>absolutely flat</term> (or <term>weakly étale</term>) if <m>A \to B</m>
        and <m>B \otimes_A B \to B</m> are both flat. In particular, <m>B \otimes_A^L B \to B</m> is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, any étale morphism is absolutely flat.
        Also, any colimit of absolutely flat morphisms is absolutely flat;
        in particular, localization at any multiplicative subset (which need not be of finite type) is absolutely flat.

      <p>
        The <term>pro-étale topology</term> on <m>\Ring^{\op}</m>, as considered by Bhatt<ndash/>Scholze <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze-proetale"/>,
        is the topology generated by finite disjoint unions and morphisms which are both faithfully flat and absolutely flat.
        This includes more coverings than the Zariski topology and the étale topology, but fewer than the fpqc topology.

      Modeling <xref ref="def-absolutely-flat-rings"/> in analytic rings is a bit subtle; we propose the following.

        Any idempotent morphism is absolutely flat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The corresponding <term>pro-étale topology</term> on <m>\AnRing^{\op}</m> is again generated by finite families of absolutely flat morphisms <m>\{\AnSpec A_i \to \AnSpec A\}_{i \in I}</m>
        such that for <m>B := \bigoplus_i A_i</m>, the complex <xref ref="eq-proetale-topology"/> is exact

        That is, the base extension functor is not exact, which is to say that <m>\ZZ[1/p]_{\solid}</m> is not a flat <m>\ZZ_{\solid}</m>-module.

          \prod_I R \otimes_R \prod_J R \to \prod_{I \times J} R

        This failure of flatness for localizations echoes similar failures elsewhere in formal/analytic geometry.
        For instance, the completion of a non-noetherian ring with respect to a finitely generated ideal need not be flat
        (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0AL8); for similar reasons, a completed rational localization of a completed Huber ring
        need not be flat. Even in cases where flatness holds (e.g., for localizations of classical affinoid algebras), this is only
        a statement about the exactness of <em>algebraic</em> tensor products, not the <em>topological</em> tensor products that are
        more relevant. One way around this is to work systematically with <term>derived categories</term> of modules; we will take up this point later in the course.

        As a preview for how these topics will be linked, let us make an observation about the ring <m>\ZZ_p</m> of <term><m>p</m>-adic integers</term>.
        It is classically defined as the completion of the ring <m>\ZZ</m> with respect to the ideal <m>(p)</m>.
        In symbols, we can write <m>\ZZ_p</m> as the kernel of the map
        <me>
          \prod_{n \in \NN} \ZZ/p^n \ZZ \to \prod_{n \in \NN} \ZZ/p^n \ZZ, \quad (a_n)_{n \in \NN} \mapsto (a_n - a_{n+1} \pmod{p^n})_{n \in \NN}.

        In the notation of <xref ref="exa-base-extension-not-flat"/>, it is natural to define a solid analogue <m>\ZZ_{p \solid}</m> by taking the corresponding 
        kernel out of <m>M</m> (i.e., the <q>solid completion</q> of <m>\ZZ</m> along <m>(p)</m>). 
        This can be viewed as a ring object in the category of solid <m>\ZZ</m>-modules; we can then define the module category
        <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_{p \solid}}</m> by taking solid <m>\ZZ</m>-modules <m>M</m> equipped with a ring homomorphism <m>\ZZ_{p \solid} \to \iHom_{\ZZ_{\solid}}(M,M)</m>.
        This is <em>not</em> the same thing as <m>\Mod_{{\ZZ_p}_\solid}</m>, the category of solid <m>R</m>-modules for <m>R = \ZZ_p</m>, which treats <m>\ZZ_p</m> as a discrete ring;
        instead, we are taking the <m>p</m>-adic topology into account in the module structure, so we are getting something more akin to <q>topological <m>\ZZ_p</m>-modules</q>.

        Unfortunately, this favorable situation does not persist when <m>A</m> is a more general solid analytic ring.
        In that case, we should treat the Koszul complex itself as the derived version of the rational localization,
        as in <xref ref="exa-Koszul-complex-not-acyclic"/>. In order to work with this systematically, 
        one needs to consider some sort of derived rings, which we will not do for the moment.
        We will however write <m>A\left\langle \tfrac{f_1}{g}, \dots, \tfrac{f_n}{g}\right\rangle^L</m> in case we need to indicate the derived localization.

        The formula in <xref ref="eq-formula-rational-localization"/> does not change if we interpret everything as an operation of derived rings.
        This breaks down into three separate statements.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The condensed ring <m>A^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{g}]</m> is resolved by the Koszul complex associated to <m>1-gU \in A^{\triangleright}[U]</m>.
            This amounts to saying that multiplication by <m>1-gU</m> is injective on <m>A^{\triangleright}[U]</m>, which is evident because
             <m>A^{\triangleright}[U]</m> injects into <m>A^{\triangleright}\llbracket U \rrbracket</m> and multiplication by <m>1-gU</m> is an isomorphism there.
          </li>
          <li>
            The liquefaction of <m>A^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{g}][T_1,\dots,T_n]</m> at <m>\{T_1,\dots,T_n\}</m> is underived.
            This follows from <xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The final quotient is resolved by the Koszul complex associated to <m>T_1 - \tfrac{f_1}{g},\dots,T_n - \tfrac{f_n}{g} \in A^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{g}][T_1,\dots,T_n]_{\liquid \{T_1,\dots,T_n\}}</m>.
            By interpreting the construction as a series of localizations of <m>B^{\triangleright} := A^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{g}]</m>, we can treat one parameter at a time;
            we then have to check that for <m>h_i := \tfrac{f_i}{g}</m>,
            <me>
              0 \to B^{\triangleright}[T_i]_{\liquid T_i} \stackrel{\times T_i-h_i}{\to} B^{\triangleright}[T_i]_{\liquid T_i} \to B^{\triangleright}[T_i]_{\liquid T_i}/(T_i-h_i) \to 0
            </me>
            is exact at the left. That is, for <m>M = B^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_B</m>, we must check that multiplication by <m>T_i-h_i</m>
            is injective on <m>M \otimes_{B^{\triangleright}} B^{\triangleright}[T_i]_{\liquid T_i}</m>.
            Note that <m>B^{\triangleright}[T_i]_{\liquid T_i}</m> is projective in <m>\Mod_B</m>,
            so we may exploit the exact sequence
            <me>
              0 \to \ker(B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{h_i}]) \to B^{\triangleright} \to \ima(B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{h_i}]) \to 0
            </me>
            to reduce to checking the claim for <m>M = \ker(B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{h_i}])</m>
            and <m>M = \ima(B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{h_i}])</m>.
            The former holds by writing <m>M = \colim_n M_n</m> with <m>M_n := \ker(B^{\triangleright} \stackrel{\times h_i^n}{\to} B^{\triangleright})</m>,
            then noting that multiplication by <m>T_i^n</m> on <m>M_n \otimes_{B^{\triangleright}} B^{\triangleright}[T_i]_{\liquid T_i}</m>
            (which is obviously injective)
            coincides with multiplication by <m>T_i^n - h_i^n</m> and hence factors through multiplication by <m>T_i-h_i</m>.
            The latter holds because multiplication by <m>T_i-h_i</m> and <m>1-h_i^{-1}T_i</m> on <m>M = \ima(B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}[\tfrac{1}{h_i}])</m> have the same kernel,
            and the latter is injective as in the first step.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the previous discussion, we see that for any morphism <m>A \to B</m> of solid analytic rings,
        <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright}\langle \tfrac{f_1}{g},\dots,\tfrac{f_n}{g} \rangle</m> is underived.

        With notation as in <xref ref="prop-solid-rational-localization"/>, the base extension functor <m>\bullet \otimes_A B \colon \Mod_A \to \Mod_B</m>

      <p>
        Since we want to think of <m>\Mod_A</m> as the category of quasicoherent sheaves on <m>\Spa A</m>, this means that we cannot treat the category of quasicoherent sheaves
        on solid analytic rings as a sheaf for any reasonable topology, even the one generated by standard binary coverings.
        However, what is true is that the <em>derived</em> category of quasicoherent sheaves is a sheaf for this topology, and even some richer topologies,
        <em>provided</em> that we understand derived categories using the language of <term>stable <m>\infty</m>-categories</term>. 
        More on this in a moment!

        As noted in <xref ref="rem-no-flatness"/>, we cannot prove an analogue of <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering"/>
        for <m>\Mod_A</m> instead of its derived category because the base extension functors are not exact.
        On the other hand, working at the derived category provides some technical advantages apart from resolving this issue,
        as one can see by comparing the proof of Zariski descent for quasicoherent sheaves on schemes versus for the derived categories:
        in the derived setting essential surjectivity is formal, whereas in the underived setting it requires some nontrivial argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tradeoff is that one has to be careful about what a derived category is; the classical definition,
        where one takes the homotopy category of complexes and inverts quasi-isomorphisms (see for example <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 05RR), 
        is too crude because it loses the information of
        <em>how</em> two complexes are related; specifically, this obstructs the formation of limits and colimits.
        The language of <m>\infty</m>-categories is better suited to retain this extra information,
        and it is in this language that one can actually formulate a statement to the effect that <m>D(\QCoh)</m> is a sheaf for the adic topology.

        By contrast, we do not get a glueing statement in fixed amplitude: for example in the equivalence

        Let <m>R</m> be the solid analytic ring whose underlying ring is the discrete ring <m>\underline{\ZZ[T]}</m>;
        we describe the effect of liquefying this analytic ring with respect to <m>T</m>.
        The underlying ring is already <m>T</m>-liquid because its topology is discrete;
        however, there is a nontrivial effect of liquefaction on modules.
        To see this, 
        Let <m>R = \underline{\ZZ}[T] = \underline{\ZZ[T]}</m> be the (discrete) polynomial ring over <m>\ZZ</m>, 
        take <m>S = \{1,T\}</m>, and consider the category <m>\Mod_{R \liquid S}</m>.
        To compute the <m>S</m>-liquefaction of <m>R</m>, we first note that <m>R</m> is already solid, 
        so we need only worry about the <m>T</m>-liquefaction
        and we may compute it in <m>\Ab_\solid</m>: it is the functor <m>\ZZ\langle T \rangle</m> given by

        where <m>S</m> runs over subsets of <m>I \times \NN</m> whose projections in both directions have finite fibers.
        By contrast, <m>\ZZ_\solid[T]</m> is the functor <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid \mapsto \bigoplus_I \ZZ[T]</m>;
        this amounts to restricting <xref ref="eq-solid-affine-line"/> to finite subsets <m>S</m>
        (which only has an effect when <m>I</m> is infinite).

        corresponding to the Tate algebra in one variable (i.e., the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ[T]</m>),
        which is larger than the polynomial ring <m>\underline{\ZZ_p[T]}</m>.

          </men>.
          For the second assertion, it suffices to note that the construction in <xref ref="eq-formula-rational-localization"/> starts with the object
          <m>A^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_A</m> and then progresses through a sequence of steps that maintain membership in <m>\Mod_A</m>:
          adjunction of <m>\tfrac{1}{g}</m> (which can be viewed as passage to the free module <m>A^{\triangleright}[T]</m>
          and then quotienting by the ideal <m>1-gT</m>); adjunction of the variables <m>T_1,\dots,T_n</m>; liquefaction
          with respect to <
          m>T_1,\dots,T_n</m>; and quotienting by the ideal <m>(f_1-gT_1,\dots,f_n-gT_n)</m>. 
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
          For <m>M = A[\underline{S}]</m>, we have by <xref ref="lem-identify-solidification-of-free"/>
          <me>
            M \cong A \otimes_\solid \ZZ[\underline{S}]_\solid \cong A \otimes_\solid \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ} = \prod_\NN A

          and

            \iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(P, M) = \iHom_{\CAb_\solid}(P_\solid, M) = \prod_J \bigoplus_\NN \underline{\ZZ}
          </me>;
          this proves the claim in this case because the formation of <m>M \otimes^L_A A^{\triangleright}[T]_{\liquid T}</m> is compatible
          with infinite products.
          We deduce the general case by noting that both sides of the claimed isomorphism are compatible with colimits
          (using <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          See also <xref ref="lem-tensor-with-liquid-T-general"/> for an alternate proof that also yields a somewhat more general result.

          For each <m>m</m>, we get a map
          <me>
            M \otimes_{A^{\triangleright}} A^{\triangleright}[T]_{\liquid T^m q} \to \iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(P_m, M)
          </me>
          taking <m>x \otimes \sum_n a_n T^n</m> to <m>[n] \mapsto a_n q^{-\lfloor n/m \rfloor} x</m>.
          Since <m>\iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(P_m, M) \in \Mod_A</m> this map formally promotes to the tensor product taken in <m>\Mod_A</m>
          rather than in <m>\Mod_{A^{\triangleright}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the other direction, note that in <xref ref="eq-tensor-with-liquid-T-transition"/>,
          the exponent <m>\lfloor n/m \rfloor - \lfloor n/(m+1) \rfloor</m> is bounded below by some linear function of <m>n</m>.
          Consequently, for each <m>m</m> we get a map 
          <me>
           \iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(P_m, M) \to M \otimes_A A^{\triangleright}[T]_{\liquid T^{m+1} q}
          </me>.
          The composition of these two maps is easily seen to induce the identity on <m>\iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(P_m, M)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The claim is now that on one hand the left-hand side of <xref ref="eq-tensor-with-liquid-T-general"/> is in fact underived,
          and on the other hand the two maps described above compose to the identity in both directions.
          Taking these claims together, and using the fact that the right-hand side is an exact functor of <m>M</m> by <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>,
          we may formally reduce to the case <m>M = A[\underline{S}]</m> with <m>S \in \Prof</m>.
          As in the proof of <xref ref="lem-tensor-with-liquid-T"/>, we may further reduce to the <q>universal</q> case 
          <me>
            A = (\underline{\ZZ[q^\pm]}, \Mod_{\underline{\ZZ[q^\pm]}\liquid q})
          </me>.
          Note that here we are topologizing <m>\ZZ[q^\pm]</m> with the <em>discrete</em> topology, so its associated condensed ring is already <m>q</m>-liquid;
          this differs from the situation considered in <xref ref="def-initial-base-ring"/> in which <m>q</m> was forced to be topologically nilpotent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this setting, we can compute directly that 
          <me>
            \colim_m A[\underline{S}] \otimes^L_{A^{\triangleright}} A^{\triangleright}[T]_{\liquid T^m q} \cong
            \colim_m A[\underline{S}][T]_{\liquid T^m q}

        Equip <m>\ZZ[q]</m> with the discrete topology. Then the morphism <m>\underline{\ZZ[q]} \to \underline{\ZZ[q]}_{\liquid q}</m>

        To see that <m>\underline{\ZZ[q]} \to \underline{\ZZ[q]}_{\liquid q}</m> is flat, we may argue as in <xref ref="eq-sequence-space-idempotent"/>:
        form the exact sequence

        To see that <m>\underline{\ZZ[q]}_{\liquid q} \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ[q]}} \underline{\ZZ[q]}_{\liquid q} \cong \underline{\ZZ[q]}</m>,
        use the explicit description of <m>\underline{\ZZ[q]}_{\liquid q}</m> given in <xref ref="prop-initial-analytic"/> to see that

          Set <m>K := \Hom_{\ZZ}(Q, \ZZ)</m>.
          We then have a natural evaluation map <m>Q \to \prod_K \ZZ</m>; let <m>Q'</m> be its image.
          By <xref ref="lem-prod-Z-is-free"/>, the target <m>\prod_K \ZZ</m> is a free <m>\ZZ</m>-module, as then by

        By the same token, if <m>Q,Q'</m> are two <m>\ZZ</m>-modules

        To begin with, if one of <m>Q</m> or <m>Q'</m> is zero, then the other is both free

        Next, <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(\bullet, \ZZ_\solid)</m> is right exact because
        <m>iExt^2_{\ZZ_\solid}(\bullet, \ZZ_\solid)</m> is identically zero, so we may apply the previous case to
        <m>\coker(Q \to Q')</m> to deduce that <m>Q \to Q'</m> is surjective.
        Finally, by <xref ref="lem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes"/> we have

          (applied to the image of <m>g</m>),
          after removing a summand of <m>N</m> of the form <m>\prod_K \ZZ_\solid</m>,

          At this point, the sequence <xref ref="eq-hom-from-torsion-sequence"/> continues

        The cardinality condition in <xref ref="lem-countable-sub-of-product-is-free"/>

        necessarily with <m>|I| = 2^{\aleph_0}</m>.
        The image of <m>\bigoplus_\NN \ZZ \to \prod_\NN \ZZ</m> would then be contained in <m>\bigoplus_J \ZZ</m>

          note that we are now considering <em>discrete</em> <m>\ZZ</m>-modules, so we may write <m>\ZZ</m> instead of <m>\ZZ_\solid</m>

        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/>, <m>\ima(h)</m> is also a free <m>\ZZ</m>-module, so the source

      On a related note, we have the following.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-liquid-to-power-bounded">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a condensed commutative ring.
          If <m>R \in \Mod_{R \liquid g}</m> for some <m>g \in R(*)</m>, then <m>g</m> is universally power-bounded.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We algebraize the statement that if the sequence <m>([n])_n</m> in <m>P \otimes R</m> is summable against <m>g</m>,
          then the sequence <m>(g^n [n])_n</m> is summable against <m>1</m> and hence is a null sequence.
          Start with the map <m>P \otimes P \otimes R \to P \otimes R</m>
          which carries <m>[m] \otimes [n] \otimes r</m> to <m>[n] \otimes r</m> if <m>m \leq n</m> and <m>0</m> otherwise.
          Since <m>R</m> is <m>g</m>-liquid, this map admits an inverse image <m>h\colon P \otimes P \otimes R \to P \otimes R</m>
          under <m>(\id \otimes \Delta_g)^*</m>. Now pull back <m>h</m> along the map <m>P \otimes R \to P \otimes P \otimes R</m>
          taking <m>[n] \otimes r</m> to <m>[n] \otimes [0] \otimes r</m>, and then along the map <m>\Delta \otimes \id</m>;
          the result is a map <m>P \otimes R \to P \otimes R</m> which does indeed take <m>[n]</m> to <m>g^n [n]</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>

      <p>
        We say that <m>g \in R(*)</m> is <term>universally power-bounded</term> if there is an element of <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, P \otimes R)</m> taking <m>[n]</m> to <m>g^n[n]</m> for all <m>n \in \NN</m>;
        the corresponding element of <m>\Hom_R(P \otimes R, P \otimes R)</m> is then a ring homomorphism.
        If <m>R</m> is a topological ring, this implies that for every topological <m>R</m>-module <m>M</m> and every null sequence <m>(m_n)_n</m> in <m>M</m>,
        <m>(g^n m_n)_n</m> is also a null sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>g</m> is topologically nilpotent, then it is also universally power-bounded.
        Moreover, both properties are <q>integrally closed</q> in <m>R(*)</m>:
        if <m>g \in R(*)</m> and <m>g^n</m> is universally power-bounded (resp. topologically nilpotent), then so is <m>g</m>.
      </p>

        Since we are assuming that <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> is solid as a condensed abelian group, 
        by <xref ref="rem-f-solidification-versus-fg"/> and <xref ref="lem-liquid-to-power-bounded"/>,
        this is equivalent to the condition given in <xref ref="def-R-topologically-nilpotent"/>.

      <p>
        In fact, it is not even necessary to specify that <m>q \in A^{\triangleright}(*)^\times</m> is power-bounded,
        as this is forced by <xref ref="lem-liquid-to-power-bounded"/>.

        <p>
          To see that <m>\Mod_{R \liquid f} \subseteq \Mod_{R \liquid f^n}</m>,
          we algebraize the statement that a null sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> is summable against <m>f^n</m>
          if and only if its <m>n</m>-fold expansion <m>(m_0,\dots,0,m_1, 0,\dots,0,m_2,\dots)</m> is summable against <m>f</m>, in which case the sums coincide.

          The maps <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> are split surjections, so <m>g_1^*</m> and <m>g_2^*</m> is a split injection.
          For any <m>M \in \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m>,
          since <m>\Delta_f^*</m> is an isomorphism on <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(P, M)</m>,
          tracing around the square as in <xref ref="lem-replace-bounded-with-P-solid"/>

          However, we cannot do much with this because <m>h_g^*</m> is not itself surjective.

          This corresponds to the fact that <m>h_g \circ \Delta_{f} = \Delta_{fg} \circ h_g</m> where

          While <m>h_g</m> is not surjective, we can fix this by replacing it with <m>h_g \oplus \lambda\colon P \oplus P \to P</m>

        While <xref ref="thm-localization-is-flat"/> is analogous to the flatness of Zariski localizations in commutative algebra,
        it has no real counterpart elsewhere in analytic geometry.
        For instance, it is not true that rational localizations of Huber rings are always flat even in the algebraic sense;
        in cases where this does hold (e.g., for classical affinoid algebras) one still does not get an exact base extension functor on complete
        topological modules. The latter is perhaps not so surprising because taking a tensor product of topological modules in the condensed setting does
        not necessarily return a topological module; this is the same issue arising in <xref ref="rem-rational-subspace-derived"/>.

        A morphism <m>A \to B</m> of analytic rings is <term>faithfully flat</term> if <m>A \to B</m> is flat and

      <p>
        The <term>flat topology</term> (or <term>fpqc topology</term>)

        such that <m>A \to B := \bigoplus_i A_i</m> is faithfully flat.
        For example, any covering for the idempotent topology is also a covering for the flat topology.

    <example>
      <p>
        For any analytic ring <m>A</m>, <m>A \to A[T]</m> is a covering for the flat topology.
        For <m>A</m> solid, by <xref ref="exa-rational-localization-is-idempotent"/>, 
        <m>A[T] \to A[T]_{\liquid T}</m> is flat, so

      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an analytic ring. Fix a finite étale morphism <m>A^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}</m>;
        then <m>B^{\triangleright}</m> is finite projective as an <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>-module, so <m>B^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_A</m>.

          It suffices to prove the second statement.

            F \colon [0] \mapsto B, [1] \mapsto B \otimes B, \dots

          Again, the base extension functor from <m>A</m> to <m>F</m> admits a right adjoint (restriction of scalars),
          and using <xref ref="eq-proetale-topology"/> we see that the unit of the adjunction is an equivalence on <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>.
          The counit is an equivalence for formal reasons: it can be interpreted as base extension from <m>B</m> to <m>B \otimes_A B</m>
          and then back to <m>B</m> via the multiplication map.

          Since <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> is represented by a sequential topological abelian group,
          a morphism <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty \times S}] \to \underline{M}</m> corresponds to a continuous map <m>f</m>
          from <m>\NN_\infty \times S</m> to <m>M</m>;
          we may thus check the claimed vanishing in the case where <m>S</m> is a singleton.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, the condition that the restriction to <m>\ZZ[\underline{\{\infty\}}]</m> vanishes implies that
          <m>f(\infty) = 0</m>.
          The condition that the restriction to <m>\ima(\Delta)</m> vanishies implies that <m>f(n) = f(n+1)</m>
          for all <m>n \in \NN</m>. By continuity, we deduce that <m>f</m> is identically zero.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Since <m>P</m> is represented by a sequential topological abelian group (<xref ref="def-internally-projective-object"/>),
        <xref ref="lem-top-group-no-derived-solidification"/> implies that the underived and derived solidifications of <m>P</m> coincide.
        This can also be seen from <xref ref="rem-express-solidification-using-cof"/>: it suffices to check that
        <m>\iExt^1_{\CAb}(P, M) = 0</m> for any <m>M \in \CAb_\solid</m>, 
        but since any extension of <m>M</m> by <m>P</m> is again solid (by <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>) we may apply <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/> and adjunction to see that any such extension splits.
        (See <xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/> for the same observation in a more general setting.)
      </p>
    </remark>
        If <m>M</m> is concentrated in degrees <m>[a,b]</m>, then by <xref ref="eq-resolve-cofinite-mod-Z"/> 
        its derived solidification is concentrated in degrees <m>[a-1,b]</m>.
          the promotion to the derived coalescence follows from <xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/>.
      <p>
        which means that if <m>M</m> is concentrated in degrees <m>[a,b]</m>, then its derived <m>f</m>-coalescence is concentrated in degrees <m>[a-1,b]</m>.
        In particular, for <m>M \in \Mod_R</m> the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence is concentrated in degrees <m>-1</m> and <m>0</m>,
        with the term in degree <m>-1</m> being <m>\iHom_R(\coker(\Delta_f)/R, M)</m>;
        this makes it clear that this term is nonzero for instance when <m>M = \coker(\Delta_f)/R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of the resolution <xref ref="eq-resolve-coker-mod-R-liquefaction"/> has the following important consequence for the construction of analytic rings.
        Let <m>R_0 = (R_0^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{R_0})</m> be an analytic ring,
        choose <m>f \in R_0(*)</m>, and let <m>\Mod_{R_1} := \Mod_{R_0 \liquid f}</m> be the full subcategory of <m>f</m>-coalescent objects in <m>\Mod_{R_0}</m>.
        Then the underived <m>f</m>-coalescence <m>R_1^{\triangleright}</m> of <m>R_0^{\triangleright}</m> has the property that for any <m>M \in \Mod_{R_1}</m>,
        <m>\Ext^1_{R_0^{\triangleright}}(R_1^\triangleright, M) = 0</m>: for any exact sequence in <m>\Mod_{R_0^{\triangleright}}</m> of the form
        <me>
          0 \to M \to M' \to R_1^{\triangleright} \to 0
        </me>
        we have <m>M' \in \Mod_{R_1}</m> by <xref ref="prop-liquefaction"/>, so any splitting of the pullback sequence
        <me>
          0 \to M \to M' \times_{R_1^{\triangleright}} R_0^{\triangleright} \to R_0^{\triangleright} \to 0
        </me>
        (which exists because <m>R_0^{\triangleright}</m> is projective as a module over itself)
        extends by adjunction to a splitting of the original sequence.
        By replacing <m>M</m> with <m>\iHom_{R_0^{\triangleright}}(R_0^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}], M)</m>,
        we formally upgrade this conclusion to assert that <m>\iExt^1_{R_0^{\triangleright}}(R_1^\triangleright, M) = 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this, we see that <m>R_1^{\triangleright}</m> is also the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>R_0^{\triangleright}</m>.
        That is, the issue
        raised in <xref ref="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic"/> does not arise in this context,
        and so <m>R_1 = (R_1^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{R_1})</m> is itself an analytic ring. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By similar logic, starting from the fact that <m>P</m> is internally projective in <m>\CAb</m> (<xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>),
        we may see that the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>P \otimes R_0^{\triangleright}</m> equals <m>P \otimes R_1^{\triangleright}</m> placed in degree 0,
        which is again internally projective in <m>\Mod_{R_1}</m>.
      </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a sheafy solid analytic ring and choose <m>f,g \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> generating the unit ideal.
          Then the base extension functor
          <men xml:id="eq-derived-base-extension-functor-loose">
            D(\Mod_A) \to D(\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g \right\rangle}) \times_{D(\Mod_{A \left\langle f/g, g/f \right\rangle})} D(\Mod_{A \left\langle g/f \right\rangle})
          </men>
          is an equivalence of categories.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Each of the functors from <m>D(\Mod_A)</m> to one of the other categories has a right adjoint (restriction of scalars), so the same is true of
          the base extension. It thus remains to establish that the unit and the counit of this adjunction are equivalences.
          To simplify notation, let us rewrite <xref ref="eq-derived-base-extension-functor"/> as
          <me>
            D(\Mod_A) \to D(\Mod_{A_1}) \times_{D(\Mod_{A_{12}})} D(\Mod_{A_{2}})
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check the unit, note that by <xref ref="lem-sheafy-exact-sequence"/>, the sequence <xref ref="eq-sheafy-exact-sequence"/> is exact.
          For any <m>M \in D(\Mod_A)</m>, we may take the (derived) tensor product of this sequence with <m>M</m> to obtain a morphism from the mapping cone of
          <me>
            M \otimes_A A_1 \oplus M \otimes_A A_2 \to M \otimes_A A_{12}
          </me>
          to <m>M</m> in <m>D(\Mod_A)</m> which inverts the adjunction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the counit, we first apply the universal property of localization to see that the multiplication maps
          <men xml:id="eq-double-base-extension">
            A_{S_1} \otimes^L_A A_{S_2} \to A_{S_1 \cup S_2}
          </men>
          are isomorphisms for any subsets <m>S_1, S_2</m> of <m>\{1,2\}</m>. Using these isomorphisms, we see that if we start with <m>M_i \in \Mod_{A_i}</m>
          and ismoorphisms <m>M_i \otimes_{A_i} A_{12} \cong M_{12}</m>, the counit is a map from <m>(M_1 \times_{M_{12}} M_2) \otimes^L_A A_i \in \Mod_{A_i}</m>
          to <m>M_i \otimes^L_A A_i</m> and then to <m>M_i</m>, and using <xref ref="eq-double-base-extension"/> we can produce inverses to both factors.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
      <p>
        By analogy with <xref ref="def-loose-rational-localization"/>, we define also the 
        associated <term>loose dagger localization</term> by taking the same morphism of underlying rings,
        but with the induced module category.
        This will be an idempotent morphism.
      </p>
        <p>
          We then apply the previous case and <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/>
          to work locally on <m>A</m>, and thereby reduce to the case where (without loss of generality) <m>A = A^{\triangleright}\left\langle \tfrac{f}{g} \right\rangle^\dagger_q</m>.
          In that case, <m>A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \tfrac{g}{f} \right\rangle^\dagger_q = A^{\triangleright}\left\langle \tfrac{f}{g}, \tfrac{g}{f} \right\rangle^\dagger_q</m>
          and the sequence in question is split exact.
        </p>
          This further reduces to mapping <m>\underline{\ZZ}[q^{\pm}]\langle U \rangle[T]/(T^m q - U)</m> to <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^{m+1} q}</m>.
          To do this, we first reduce to the universal case <m>R = \underline{\ZZ((r))}[q^{\pm}]</m>;
          then apply <xref ref="lem-liquefaction-is-Tate-algebra"/> to equate <m>R \langle T \rangle</m> with <m>R[T]_{\liquid T}</m>;
          and finally apply <xref ref="eq-dagger-transition"/> to obtain
          <me>
            (T^m q)^n = (T^{m+1} q)^{\lfloor \frac{nm}{m+1} \rfloor} T^{nm-(m+1)\lfloor \frac{nm}{m+1}\rfloor} q^{n - \lfloor \frac{nm}{m+1}\rfloor}
          </me>
          and note that the exponent of <m>T</m> is at most <m>m</m> while the exponent of <m>q</m> is at least <m>\tfrac{n}{m+1} - 1</m>.
        <p>
          
          To produce the map from left to right, we first observe that the target belongs to <m>\Mod_{R[T]\liquid q}</m>;
          it thus suffices to map <m>\underline{\ZZ}[q^{\pm}]\langle T \rangle^\dagger_q</m> to <m>\colim_m R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m>.
          By hypothesis, <m>R</m> is an algebra over <m>R = \underline{\ZZ((r))}[q^{\pm}]</m>;
          by <xref ref="lem-liquefaction-is-Tate-algebra"/> we may equate <m>\underline{\ZZ((r))}[q^{\pm}] \langle U \rangle</m> with <m>\underline{\ZZ((r))}[q^{\pm}][U]_{\liquid U}</m>.
          We thus obtain a map from <m>\underline{\ZZ}[q^{\pm}]\langle U \rangle[T]/(T^m q - U)</m> to <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m>.
          To produce the map from right to left, we show that <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m> maps to
          <m>R \otimes_{\liquid q} \underline{\ZZ}[q^{\pm}]\langle U \rangle[T]/(T^{m+1} q - U)</m>.
          Since the claim is universal in <m>R</m>, it suffices to work at the level of global sections:
          a global section of <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m> can be written as <m>\sum_n r_n T^n</m> with <m>r_n \in R(*)</m>
          such that <m>r_n q^{-\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \rfloor}</m> is a null sequence.
          By rewriting this as <m>r_n q^{-\lfloor \frac{n}{m+1} \rfloor}</m> times <m>q^{\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{n}{m+1} \rfloor}</m>
          and noting that the exponent is at least <m>\tfrac{n}{m(m+1)} - 1</m>, we see that the sum can be formed in 
          <m>R \otimes_{\liquid q} \underline{\ZZ}[q^{\pm}]\langle U \rangle[T]/(T^{m+1} q - U)</m>.
        </p>
