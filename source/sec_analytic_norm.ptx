      In this section, we introduce the concept of a norm on an analytic ring, 
      set up in a way that will make it compatible with the theory of analytic stacks.

    <title>Norms and Gelfand<ndash/>Berkovich spectra</title>
    <p>
      The concepts of a <term>submultiplicative seminorm</term> on a commutative ring,
      and the resulting concept of a <term>commutative Banach ring</term>, were introduced in <xref ref="def-submult-seminorm"/>.
      While this is ultimately <em>not</em> the model for the concept of a norm on an analytic ring,
      it will be helpful to recall some related points.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exa-gauss-norm">
      <p>
        If <m>R</m> carries a submultiplicative seminorm <m>|\bullet|</m>, then for any <m>\rho \geq 0</m>,
        we can define a submultiplicative seminorm on <m>R[T]</m> by the formula
        <md>
          \left| \sum_i x_i T^i \right|_\rho = \sum_i |x|_i \rho^i.
        </md>
        If the seminorm on <m>R</m> is nonarchimedean, we can replace the summation with the supremum in this definition
        to recover the <term><m>\rho</m>-Gauss seminorm</term>. The terminology arises from the fact that if the original seminorm on <m>R</m> is both nonarchimedean
        and multiplicative, then adapting the proof of Gauss's lemma on integer polynomials shows that the <m>\rho</m>-Gauss seminorm is again multiplicative.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-Banach-neighborhood-units">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative Banach ring, the set of units in <m>R</m> is an open subset.
        More precisely, for any <m>x \in R^\times</m>, the open ball <m>\{y \in R\colon |x-y| \lt |x^{-1}|^{-1}\}</m> consists entirely of units:
        for <m>y</m> in the ball, <m>|1-y/x| \leq |x-y| |x^{-1}| \lt 1</m> and so the series <m>x^{-1} \sum_i (1-y/x)^i</m> converges to an inverse of <m>x(1-y/x) = y</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-quotient-to-field">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative Banach ring, for any maximal ideal <m>\frakm</m> of <m>R</m>, 
        define the quotient seminorm on <m>F := R/\frakm</m> taking <m>x</m> to the infimum of <m>|y|</m> over all <m>y \in R</m> lifting <m>x</m>.
        We verify that this is in fact a submultiplicative norm
        with respect to which <m>F</m> is again complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note first that if <m>y \in 1 + \frakm</m>, then <m>|y| \geq 1</m> as otherwise <xref ref="rem-Banach-neighborhood-units"/> would 
        imply that <m>1-y \in \frakm</m> is a unit, a contradiction (as the existence of a maximal ideal forces <m>R \neq 0</m>).
        By the same token, for any <m>y \in R \setminus \frakm</m>, we can find <m>z \in R \setminus \frakm</m> with <m>yz \equiv 1 \pmod{\frakm}</m>,
        and then <m>|yz| \geq 1</m> and so <m>|y| \geq |z|^{-1}</m>; since we can choose <m>z</m> depending only on the image of <m>y</m> in <m>R</m>,
        this shows that the quotient seminorm is a norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, note that if <m>(x_n)</m> is a null sequence in <m>F</m>, then for any fixed <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>, we can lift each <m>x_n</m> to <m>y_n \in R</m>
        so that <m>|y_n|</m> is at most <m>1+\epsilon</m> times the quotient seminorm of <m>x_n</m>. Consequently, the <m>y_n</m> form a null sequence in <m>R</m>,
        which is thus summable to some limit <m>y</m>; hence the <m>x_n</m> also form a sequence summable to the image <m>x</m> of <m>y</m> in <m>F</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-multiplicativity-on-field">
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a field equipped with a submultiplicative seminorm <m>|\bullet|</m> (e.g., the field <m>F</m> of <xref ref="rem-quotient-to-field"/>).
        Then for any <m>x \in R^\times</m>, <m>|x| |x^{-1}| \geq |1| = 1</m>; consequently, <m>|\bullet|</m> is actually a norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general the norm need not be multiplicative. However, in this case multiplicativity can be deduced from the formally weaker condition that
        <m>|x| |x^{-1}| = 1</m> for all <m>x \in R^\times</m>: this condition implies that for <m>x \in R^\times, y \in R</m>, 
        <md>
          |xy| \leq |x| |y| \leq |x| |x^{-1}| |xy| = |xy|
        </md>;
        hence <m>|xy| = |x| |y|</m> when <m>x</m> is nonzero, and obviously also when <m>x =0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a different and subtler question to ask whether or not the topology on <m>R</m> can also be defined by some multiplicative norm.
        See <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-Banach"/> for discussion of this issue in the nonarchimedean case.

      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring equipped with a submultiplicative norm <m>|\bullet|</m>.
        The <term>Gelfand<ndash/>Berkovich spectrum</term> of <m>R</m> is the set <m>\calM(R)</m> of multiplicative seminorms <m>\alpha</m> on <m>R</m>
        which are dominated by <m>|\bullet|</m> (meaning that <m>\alpha(x) \leq |x|</m> for all <m>x \in R</m>).
        We upgrade this to a topological space by viewing this as a subspace of <m>\prod_{x \in R} \RR_{\geq 0}</m>,
        or equivalently <m>\prod_{x \in R} [0, |x|]</m>; from the latter point of view we see that <m>\calM(R)</m> is compact Hausdorff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <m>\calM(R)</m> is unchanged by replacing <m>R</m> with the completion with respect to the seminorm.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-gelfand-spectrum-nonempty">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>R</m> a nonzero commutative Banach ring, <m>\calM(R) \neq \emptyset</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We give the argument from <xref ref="bib-Berkovich"/>, Theorem 1.2.1 (filling in some details).
          Using <xref ref="rem-quotient-to-field"/>, by quotienting by some maximal ideal we may reduce to the case where <m>R</m> is a field,
          which ensures that every submultiplicative seminorm on <m>R</m> is actually a norm (<xref ref="rem-multiplicativity-on-field"/>).
          By Zorn's lemma, the space of submultiplicative norms on <m>R</m> dominated by <m>|\bullet|</m> contains a minimal element <m>\alpha</m> with respect to domination.
          It will suffice to check that any such element is in fact multiplicative.
          By <xref ref="rem-multiplicativity-on-field"/>, it suffices to check that <m>\alpha(x)^{-1} = \alpha(x^{-1})</m> for all <m>x \in R^\times</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose the contrary; since <m>\alpha(x) \alpha(x^{-1}) \geq \alpha(1) = 1</m> by submultiplicativity, we must have <m>\alpha(x^{-1}) \gt \alpha(x)^{-1}</m>.
          Set <m>\rho := \alpha(x^{-1})^{-1}</m>;
          by the same token, for any positive integer <m>i</m>, <m>\alpha(x^{-i}) \alpha(x^{-1})^i \geq 1</m> and so <m>\alpha(x^{-i}) \geq \rho^{-i}</m>.
          In particular, the sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty \alpha(x^{-i}) \rho^i</m> diverges.
          Now let <m>S</m> be the completion of <m>R[T]</m> for the seminorm defined in <xref ref="exa-gauss-norm"/> with respect to <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\rho</m>,
          viewed as a subring of <m>R \llbracket T \rrbracket</m>; then <m>(1-x^{-1}T)^{-1} \notin S</m>, so <m>1-x^{-1} T</m> is not a unit in <m>S</m>.
          Hence the map <m>R \to S/(x-T)</m> is injective and we can pull back the quotient seminorm from <m>S/(x-T)</m> to <m>R</m>;
          this gives a submultiplicative norm <m>\beta</m> on <m>R</m> such that <m>\beta(y) \leq \alpha(y)</m> for all <m>y \in R</m> (by lifting <m>y</m> to itself)
          but <m>\beta(x) \lt \alpha(x)</m> (by lifting <m>x</m> to <m>T</m>), a contradiction.

    <corollary xml:id="cor-Gelfand-spectrum-unit">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>R</m> a nonzero commutative Banach ring, an element <m>x \in R</m> is invertible if and only if <m>\alpha(x) \neq 0</m>
          for all <m>\alpha \in \calM(R)</m>.

        <p>
          Let <m>I</m> be the closure of the ideal <m>(x)</m>. By hypothesis, <m>\calM(R/I)</m> is empty, so
          <xref ref="prop-gelfand-spectrum-nonempty"/> that <m>I</m> is the unit ideal.
          By <xref ref="rem-Banach-neighborhood-units"/>, this means that <m>(x)</m> contains a unit, and so <m>x</m> is itself a unit.

      <p>
        Take <m>R = \ZZ</m> equipped with the archimedean absolute value <m>|\bullet|_\infty</m>.
        Using Ostrowski's theorem, we may classify the points <m>\alpha \in \calM(\ZZ)</m> as follows.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The trivial norm: <m>\alpha(x) = 1</m> for all nonzero <m>x \in \ZZ</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            For <m>c \in (0,1]</m>, the scaled archimedean norm <m>\alpha(x) = |x|_\infty^c</m>.
            (We cannot take <m>c \gt 1</m> as then the triangle inequality would fail; see <xref ref="rem-Berkovich-space-of-ZZ"/>.)
          </li>
          <li>
            For <m>p</m> prime and <m>c \in (0, +\infty)</m>, the scaled <m>p</m>-adic norm <m>\alpha|x| = |x|_p^c</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            For <m>p</m> prime, the seminorm pulled back from the trivial norm on <m>\FF_p</m>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can get some partial information about the topology by noting that on one hand the map <m>[0,1] \to \calM(\ZZ)</m> taking <m>c</m> to <m>|x|_\infty^c</m> (meaning the trivial norm for <m>c=0</m>)
        is continuous; and on the other hand, for each prime <m>p</m> the map <m>[0, \infty] \to \calM(\ZZ)</m> taking <m>c</m> to <m>|x|_p^c</m> (meaning the trivial norm for <m>c=0</m>
        and the pullback of the trivial norm on <m>\FF_p</m> for <m>c = \infty</m>) is also continuous.
      </p>
      <p>
        To describe the topology completely, note that on one hand, any nontrivial <m>\alpha \in \calM(\ZZ)</m> lies on exactly one of the segments described above and this forms
        a compact neighborhood of <m>\alpha</m>. On the other hand, any neighborhood of the trivial norm contains the entire segments corresponding to all but many primes <m>p</m>.
        An efficient description of the resulting space is that it is homeomorphic to the union of the segment from <m>[0,0]</m> to <m>[0,1]</m> (corresponding
        to the segment ending at <m>|\bullet|_\infty</m>) with, for each prime <m>p</m>, the segment from <m>[0,0]</m> to <m>[1/p, 1/p^2]</m>.

    <remark xml:id="rem-Berkovich-space-of-ZZ">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-Berkovich-space-of-ZZ"/>, the fact that the branch of <m>\calM(\ZZ)</m> containing the points <m>\alpha(x) = |x|_\infty^c</m>
        is truncated at <m>c=1</m> is arguably a bit artificial: for <m>c \gt 1</m>, the function <m>|x|_\infty^c</m> still satisfies a somewhat
        weaker form of the triangle inequality. More importantly, the balls with respect to this function still define the archimedean topology.

      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a ring equipped with a submultiplicative seminorm <m>|\bullet|_R</m>,
        define the associated <term>spectral seminorm</term> by the formula
        <md>
          |x|_{\spect,R} = \lim_{n \to \infty} |x^n|_R^{1/n}

        it is an elementary exercise to verify that the limit exists (and actually equals the infimum). By construction,
        <m>|\bullet|_{\spect,R}</m> is a power-multiplicative seminorm.

      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative Banach ring, it is not always the case that the spectral seminorm defines the same topology as the original norm;

        However, replacing the norm with its associated spectral seminorm does not affect <m>\calM(R)</m>:
        any multiplicative seminorm that is dominated by the original norm is also dominated by the spectral seminorm.

    <title>Norm functions</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In order to study norms on analytic rings in terms of analytic stacks, we need to adopt a shift in perspective.
        For <m>R</m> a ring, an element of <m>R</m> corresponds to a section of the projection <m>\AAA^1_R \to \Spec R</m>;
        while our conventional thinking about norms would suggest that we assign a single number to such a section, 
        it is ultimately better to think of assigning a number to each individual point on the section,
        with the supremum over these numbers corresponding to the norm in the traditional sense.
        This forces the supremum to be power-multiplicative (compare <xref ref="prop-spectral-seminorm-is-supremum"/>);
        in the case where <m>R</m> is a Banach ring,
        this means that we do not recover the topology on <m>R</m> but we do recover the Gelfand spectrum (<xref ref="def-spectral-seminorm"/>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to say this is that we want to specify a way to pick out the closed ball of radius <m>\rho</m>
        for every <m>\rho \in [0, \infty)</m>. For any given section of the projection <m>\AAA^1_R \to \Spec R</m>,
        we would like to be able to detect whether any given point on the section indeed lies in this closed ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to do this, we need to make sense of writing down an <q>analytic</q> map from <m>\AAA^1_R</m> to the nonnegative real numbers.
        We give an <em>ad hoc</em> definition here, but it will be explained later in the language of analytic stacks.

        The analytic stack <m>[0,\infty]</m> will admit a covering by <m>[0,\rho]</m> and <m>[\rho,\infty]</m> for any
        <m>\rho \in (0, \infty)</m>; this covering will pull back to the covering specified in <xref ref="def-norm-function"/>.

        Let <m>A</m> be a Tate analytic ring and fix a unit <m>q \in A^{\circ \circ}</m>
        and a constant <m>c \in (0,1)</m>.
        For <m>\rho \in (0, \infty)</m>, let <m>A_{\leq \rho}</m> be the colimit of <m>A[T]_{\liquid T^m/q^n}</m>
        over all pairs of integers <m>(m,n)</m> with <m>m \gt 0</m> and <m>c^{n/m} \gt \rho</m>.

      <p>
        When <m>A</m> is the initial Tate analytic ring (<xref ref="def-initial-base-ring"/>), it can be shown that this norm function is uniquely determined by the property that
        <m>q</m> maps identically to <m>c</m>. However, in general, each topologically nilpotent unit of <m>A</m> map into
        <m>[0,1)</m> but not necessarily to a constant.

        Let <m>A</m> be an arbitrary analytic ring and let <m>B</m> be the initial Tate analytic ring (<xref ref="def-initial-base-ring"/>). Then
        applying <xref ref="exa-norm-on-Tate-ring-by-q"/> over <m>A \otimes B</m> also gives a norm function on <m>A</m>.

      <p>
        In <xref ref="def-norm-function"/>, the last condition corresponds to requiring that any topologically nilpotent ring element has norm in <m>[0,1]</m>.

    <title>Application to the Tate elliptic curve</title>
    <p>
      One key application of this construction is to construct the <q>universal</q> Tate elliptic curve.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be the initial Tate analytic ring constructed in <xref ref="def-initial-ring-liquefied"/>.
        Fix the norm function given by <xref ref="exa-norm-on-Tate-ring-by-q"/> for some <m>c \in (0,1)</m>.
        We can then define <m>\GG_{m,A}^{\an}</m> as the colimit of <m>\AnSpec R_{\leq \rho}</m> as <m>\rho \to \infty</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analytic version of the Tate elliptic curve will be the <q>free quotient</q> <m>\GG_{m,A}^{\an}/q^{\ZZ}</m>.
        One can then prove an <q>algebraization</q> statement exhibiting this as the analytification of some elliptic curve
        over <m>A</m>, which for instance one can interpret as a map from <m>\AnSpec A</m> to the <em>algebraic</em> moduli
        stack <m>M_{1,1}</m> of elliptic curves over <m>\ZZ</m>.
