  <title>Condensed sets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We describe the category of condensed sets.
      This is formally similar to the construction of solid modules, but with a rather different set of test objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in <xref ref="sec_solid1"/>, we fix an infinite cardinal <m>\kappa</m>.
      In subsequent sections we will make the blanket assumption <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m>;
      this will correspond to restricting attention to <q>light</q> condensed sets in the terminology of <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-youtube"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: by convention, whenever we write <m>\RR</m> we mean the corresponding object in <m>\Top</m> with the usual archimedean topology.
      In case we mean the underlying set with the discrete topology, we instead write <m>\RR_{\disc}</m>.

        Although we do not use this perspective here, we also wish to draw attention to the alternate interpretation
        available in the language of <term>pyknotic sets</term> of Barwick<ndash/>Haine <xref ref="bib-Barwick-Haine"/>.
        Roughly speaking, this amounts to using two separate cardinality cutoffs.

    <title>Pro-objects in a category</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>directed set</term> is a partially ordered set <m>(I, \leq)</m> with the property that for any <m>i,j \in I</m>,
        the set <m>\{k \in I\colon k \geq i, k \geq j\}</m> is nonempty. We may view a directed set as a category in which there
        is a single morphism <m>i \to j</m> if <m>i \leq j</m> and none otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a category <m>\calC</m>, we define an associated category <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \calC</m> as follows.
        The objects of <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \calC</m> (also called <term>pro-objects</term> of <m>\calC</m>) 
        are the <m>\kappa</m>-small inverse systems,
        i.e., contravariant functors to <m>\calC</m> out of directed sets of cardinality <m> \leq \kappa</m>.
        The homsets are given by the formula
        <me>
          \Hom_{\varprojlim_\kappa \calC}\left(\varprojlim_{i \in I} X_i, \varprojlim_{j \in J} Y_j\right) 
          = \varprojlim_{j \in J} \left( \varinjlim_{i \in I} \Hom_{\calC}(X_i, Y_j) \right).
        </me>
        Another way to interpret <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \calC</m> is as the subcategory of <m>\Fun(\calC, \Set)^{\op}</m>
        consisting of cofiltered limits of representable functors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that for formal reasons, <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \calC</m> admits <m>\kappa</m>-small limits. Moreover,
        any functor <m>\calC \to \calC'</m> whose target admits <m>\kappa</m>-small limits
        induces a canonical <term>inverse limit functor</term> <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \calC \to \calC'</m>.
        For instance this applies when <m>\calC</m> admits a forgetful functor to <m>\Set</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-maps-between-inverse-systems">
      <p>
        In the category <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \Ab</m>,
        consider the inverse system of <m>\ZZ/p^n \ZZ</m> over all positive integers <m>n</m>, which has inverse limit <m>\ZZ_p</m>.
        According to the definition, the family of reduction maps <m>\ZZ/p^{2n} \ZZ \to \ZZ/p^n \ZZ</m> constitutes a morphism
        <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \ZZ/p^n \ZZ \to \varprojlim_\kappa \ZZ/p^n \ZZ</m>. However, this is <em>the same</em> morphism
        in <m>\varprojlim_\kappa \Ab</m> as the one constituted by the family of identity maps <m>\ZZ/p^{n} \ZZ \to \ZZ/p^n \ZZ</m>,
        which is consistent with the fact that they both induce the identity map on the inverse limits in <m>\Ab</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to say this is that if we take the inverse system of <m>\ZZ/p^{2n}\ZZ</m> over all <em>even</em> positive integers <m>n</m>,
        the resulting pro-object is isomorphic to the one we started with. More generally, this implies if we start with any index set <m>I</m>
        and replace it with a <term>cofinal</term> subset <m>I'</m>, meaning one such that for any <m>i \in I</m> there exists <m>i' \in I'</m>
        with <m>i \leq i'</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-change-pro-system">
      <p>
        Building on <xref ref="exa-maps-between-inverse-systems"/>, keep in mind that pro-objects indexed by different partially
        ordered sets <m>I</m> can nonetheless be isomorphic; that is, the index set is not an intrinsic datum of a pro-object but only
        an artifact used to give a concrete description.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is closely related (via Stone duality; see <xref ref="rem-Stone-duality"/>) 
        to the fact that it is useful to describe a topology on a set in terms of a neighborhood basis,
        but the neighborhood basis is not an intrinsic datum of the resulting topological space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another side effect is that it can be confusing to think about properties of a morphism of pro-objects such as injectivity or surjectivity.
        It is better to view these as properties of the corresponding morphisms of topological spaces (again see <xref ref="rem-Stone-duality"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        As an example of <xref ref="rem-change-pro-system"/>,
        consider the category of pro-systems of abelian groups, for which the inverse limit functor is left exact
        and hence admits right derived functors. 
        For <em>sequential</em> pro-objects the derived functors
        beyond <m>R^1 \varprojlim</m> all vanish (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 07KW);
        by <xref ref="rem-change-pro-system"/> the same applies to any countable
        pro-object in abelian groups.
        By contrast, for a larger pro-object it can happen that <m>R^i \varprojlim</m> is nonzero for <m>i \gt 1</m>.

    <title>The category of profinite sets</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The category of <term>profinite sets</term> is defined to be <m>\Prof := \varprojlim_\kappa \Set^{\fin}</m> 
        where <m>\Set^{\fin}</m> denotes the full subcategory of <m>\Set</m> consisting of finite sets.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We introduce two key examples, one <q>maximal</q> and one <q>minimal</q>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        By the <term>(abstract) Cantor set</term>, we will mean the object <m>\{0,1\}^{\NN}</m> of <m>\Prof</m>
        indexed by <m>\NN</m>, where <m>n</m> corresponds to <m>\{0,1\}^n</m> and the projection <m>\{0,1\}^{n+1} \to \{0,1\}^n</m>
        is the map that forgets the last coordinate.
        This example is in a certain sense maximal when <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m>; see <xref ref="rmk-Cantor-set-surjection"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-one-point-compactification-of-N">
      <p>
        Let <m>\NN_\infty</m> be the object of <m>\Prof</m> indexed by <m>\NN</m>, where <m>n</m> corresponds to <m>\{1,\dots,n,\infty\}</m>
        and the projection <m>\{1,\dots,n+1,\infty\} \to \{1,\dots,n,\infty\}</m>.
        This example plays an important role in the relationship between topological spaces and condensed sets;
        see <xref ref="rem-interpret-sequential-limits"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      We will freely pass between the given definition of profinite sets and the following alternate interpretation.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-Stone-duality">
      <title>Stone duality, part 1</title>
      <p>
        Since <m>\Set</m> admits limits, we obtain a natural functor <m>\Prof \to \Set</m> taking an inverse system to its inverse limit. 
        Alternatively, by viewing every finite set as a topological space for the
        discrete topology, we may factor <m>\Prof \to \Set</m> through the category <m>\Top</m> of topological spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now observe that the inverse limit of a family of Hausdorff topological spaces is a <em>closed</em> subspace of the full product over the same family:
        the compatibility with morphisms is a collection of conditions involving two factors at a time, and hence a closed condition for the product topology.
        By Tykhonoff's theorem, any product of compact Hausdorff spaces is compact, so any inverse limit of compact Hausdorff spaces is compact.
        As a result, the functor <m>\Prof \to \Top</m> factors through the full subcategory <m>\CHaus</m> of <m>\Top</m> 
        consisting of compact Hausdorff spaces admitting a neighborhood basis of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>.
        (When <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m>, Urysohn's theorem says that these are just the <term>metrizable</term> compact Hausdorff spaces.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, an object of <m>\CHaus</m> belongs to the essential image of <m>\Prof \to \Top</m> if and only if it is
        <term>totally disconnected</term>, meaning that any two distinct points can be separated by a partition of the
        space into two closed-open subsets.
        Namely, we can write down a corresponding inverse system with terms corresponding to the finite closed-open coverings;
        see <xref ref="rem-construct-profinite-cover"/> for the detailed construction in a more general context.
        One side effect of the construction is that we can represent any object of <m>\Prof</m> as an inverse system with <em>surjective</em> transition maps,
        which we will almost always do in practice.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-Cantor-set">
      <p>
        Note that the cardinality cutoff <m>\kappa</m> applies to a neighborhood basis of a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space,
        not to the underlying set of the topological space. For example, for <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m>, the Cantor set
        <m>\{0,1\}^{\NN}</m> belongs to <m>\Prof</m> but its underlying set <m>\prod_{n=1}^\infty \{0,1\}</m> has cardinality <m>2^\kappa</m>.

    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The object of <m>\CHaus</m> corresponding to <m>\NN_\infty \in \Prof</m> is the <term>one-point compactification</term> of <m>\NN</m>.
        That is, if we interpret <m>\NN</m> as an object of <m>\Top</m> for the discrete topology, then <m>\NN_\infty</m>
        corresponds to the topological space with underlying set <m>\NN \cup \{\infty\}</m> 
        in which an open subset of <m>\NN</m> is either an arbitrary subset of <m>\NN</m> or <m>\infty</m> 
        plus a <em>cofinite</em> subset of <m>\NN</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      In connection with Stone duality, we will make frequent use of the following fact about compact Hausdorff topological spaces,
      which in a sense makes them quite similar to objects of more algebraic categories.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-every-surjection-in-CHaus-is-quotient">
      <statement>
        Any continuous surjection <m>f\colon Y \to X</m> of compact Hausdorff spaces is a quotient map.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The quotient map property says that a subset <m>V</m> of <m>X</m> is closed if its preimage <m>f^{-1}(V)</m> is closed
          (the <q>only if</q> statement being the property that <m>f</m> is continuous). The surjectivity of <m>f</m>
          means that <m>f(f^{-1}(V)) = V</m>; since any closed subset of <m>Y</m> is again compact, <m>V</m> is the image of a
          quasicompact topological space and hence is also quasicompact (we can test whether a finite subcollection of a covering is a covering by
          checking the inverse images). 
          Since <m>X</m> is Hausdorff, 
          for any <m>x \in X \setminus V</m>, for each <m>y \in V</m> we can find open subsets separating <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          We can choose finitely many <m>y</m> so that the opens covering those <m>y</m> cover all of <m>V</m>;
          intersecting the corresponding opens covering <m>x</m> produces an open neighborhood of <m>x</m> within <m>X \setminus V</m>.
          Since <m>x \in X \setminus V</m> was arbitrary, we conclude that <m>X \setminus V</m> is open and hence <m>V</m> is closed.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      We will make occasional use of a third interpretation of profinite sets.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <title>Stone duality, part 2</title>
      <p>
        We can also describe <m>\Prof</m> in terms of Boolean algebras:
        the space <m>X</m> corresponds to <m>\Hom_{\Top}(X, \FF_2)</m>
        (i.e., the partitions of <m>X</m> into two closed-open subsets labeled <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>). 
        and we recover <m>X</m> by taking <m>\MaxSpec</m> (the set of maximal ideals with the Zariski topology). 
        From this point of view, the cardinality cutoff is that <m>|\Hom_{\Top}(X, \FF_2)| \leq \kappa</m>.

    <title>The category of condensed sets</title>
    <p>
      We now now imitate the passage from modules to solid modules over a ring to pass from sets to condensed sets.
      One important difference is that we do impose certain structure on the functors; this will correspond to enforcing the
      sheaf axiom with respect to a certain topology.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The category of <term>condensed sets</term> is the full subcategory <m>\CSet</m> of <m>\Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Set)</m> consisting of those functors <m>X</m> 
        such that:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>X</m> carries finite disjoint unions to finite products (in particular <m>X(\emptyset)</m> is a singleton set);
          </li>
          <li>
            for every surjection <m>T \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m>, the diagram

              X(S) \to X(T) \rightrightarrows X(T \times_S T)
            </me>
            is an equalizer.

      <p>
        For any <m>S \in \Prof</m>, the representable functor <m>h_S</m> belongs to <m>\CSet</m> 
        (we will prove a stronger statement in <xref ref="lem-top-space-as-condensed-set"/>).
        By Yoneda's lemma, this yields a fully faithful functor <m>\Prof \to \CSet</m>.
        We will see a bit later that <m>\CSet</m> also contains some other familiar categories
        as full subcategories, including <m>\Set</m> (<xref ref="cor-sets-are-condensed-set"/>),
        <m>\CHaus</m> (<xref ref="prop-compact-hausdorff-in-condensed"/>),
        and even a sizable subcategory of <m>\Top</m> (<xref ref="prop-sequential"/>).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-surjection-of-sheaves">
      <p>
        The compatibilities in the definition of <m>\CSet</m> can be reformulated as the statement that
        we are considering presheaves in sets on <m>\Prof</m> which are sheaves for the following Grothendieck topology:
        a family <m>\{U_i \to S\}_{i \in I}</m> of morphisms is a covering if and only if there is a <em>finite</em> subset <m>J</m> of <m>I</m>
        such that <m>\bigsqcup_{i \in J} U_i \to S</m> is surjective as a morphism in <m>\Top</m>.
        (The point is that this topology is generated by finite disjoint unions and arbitrary surjections.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that we are considering sheaves has a consequence which is standard but worth recalling here:
        while a monomorphism in <m>\CSet</m> is precisely the same thing as a pointwise injection,
        an epimorphism in <m>\CSet</m> is not necessarily a pointwise surjection.
        Rather, a morphism <m>Y \to X</m> in <m>\CSet</m> is an epimorphism if and only if the following weaker condition holds:
        for every <m>S \in \Prof</m>
        and every <m>x \in X(S)</m>, we can find a surjection <m>T \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m> such that
        <m>x</m> lifts to some <m>y \in Y(T)</m>, which need not equalize the maps <m>Y(T) \rightrightarrows Y(T \times_S T)</m>.

        as the functor is <em>not</em> faithful; that is, one cannot view condensed sets as <q>sets with extra structure</q>.

          For compatibility with surjections, note that this is obvious at the level of sets, and we can use

          Then the composition <m>\Set \to \Top \to \CSet \to \Set</m> is naturally equivalent to the identity;

        It is worth noting that there is no cardinality cutoff in <xref ref="cor-sets-are-condensed-set"/>.

        For an object <m>X \in \Top</m>,

        convergence of larger nets. This will then limit the extent to which topological spaces embed into <m>\CSet</m>,
        but not to an extent that will impede our work (<xref ref="prop-sequential" />).

      Here is a key example of a condensed set not in the essential image of <m>\Top</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-difference-on-product-is-locally-constant">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>T \to S</m> be a surjection in <m>\Prof</m>. For any abelian group <m>X</m>, if <m>f\colon T \to X</m>
          is a map of sets such that the difference between the two induced maps <m>f_1, f_2\colon T \times_S T \to X</m> is locally constant,
          then <m>f</m> is the sum of a locally constant map plus a map that factors through <m>S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By hypothesis we have a finite covering of <m>T \times_S T</m> such that <m>f_1-f_2</m> is constant on each term.
          Since the topology on <m>T \times_S T</m> is generated by products <m>U_1 \times_S U_2</m> where <m>U_i \subseteq T</m> is open,
          we may assume our covering is given by opens of this form. We can then choose a finite covering of <m>T</m> such that
          every <m>U_i</m> appearing in the previous sentence is a finite union of opens in our chosen covering.
          Then for every open <m>V</m> in our chosen covering of <m>T</m>, <m>f_1 - f_2</m> is constant on <m>V \times_S V</m>;
          let <m>g\colon T \to X</m> be the function assigning all elements of <m>V</m> to this constant value.
          Then <m>f-g</m> indeed factors through <m>S</m>.

    <example xml:id="exa-quotient-of-r-by-discrete">
      <p>
        Let <m>F \in \Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Set)</m> be the functor taking <m>S</m> to the quotient
        of the group of continuous maps <m>S \to \RR</m> by the subgroup of locally constant maps.
        It is clear that this is compatible with finite disjoint unions.
        To check compatibility with a surjection <m>T \to \RR</m>, we must check that if <m>f\colon T \to \RR</m>
        is continuous and the two maps <m>f_1, f_2\colon T \times_S T \to \RR</m> differ by a locally constant map,
        then <m>f</m> can be written as a locally constant map plus a map that factors through <m>S</m> (which will then
        necessarily be continuous); this follows from <xref ref="lem-difference-on-product-is-locally-constant"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>S</m> is a singleton, we have <m>F(S) = \{0\}</m>,
        so if <m>F</m> were in the essential image of <m>\Top</m> it would arise from a singleton space.
        However, we can compute some other evaluations to see that this is far from what is going on.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For <m>S = \NN_\infty</m>, <m>F(S)</m> consists of convergent sequences modulo eventually constant sequences,
          or equivalently, null sequences modulo sequences of finite support.
        </li>
        <li>
          For <m>S = \{0,1\}^\NN</m>, we can produce a nontrivial element of <m>F(S)</m> using the

            (s_1, s_2, \dots) \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^\infty (2s_n) 3^{-n}.

          This defines a continuous map <m>S \to \RR</m> which is not locally constant.

    <title>Free resolutions of topological spaces</title>
    <p>
      While by definition one can only evaluate condensed sets on test objects in the category of profinite sets,
      we can use the functor <m>\Top \to \CSet</m> to evaluate condensed sets on arbitrary topological spaces.
      To quantify the extent to which this retains information from <m>\Top</m>, we use the following concept.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        By a <term>free resolution</term> of an object <m>S \in \CHaus</m>, we will mean a coequalizer diagram of the form
        <me>
          S_2 \rightrightarrows S_1 \to S
        </me>
        in which <m>S_1, S_2 \in \Prof</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given such a diagram, for any <m>X \in \CSet</m> we can define the evaluation <m>X(S)</m> as an equalizer:
        <me>
          X(S) \to X(S_1) \rightrightarrows X(S_2).
        </me>
        By construction, this reproduces the previous definition when <m>X \in \Prof</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-construct-profinite-cover">
      <p>
        For any <m>S \in \CHaus</m>, we can form a surjection <m>S_1 \to S</m> with <m>S_1 \in \Prof</m> by taking an inverse limit over finite coverings
        by neighborhoods in a basis of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>. 
        More precisely, for any two finite coverings <m>\{U_i\}_{i \in I}</m> and <m>\{V_j\}_{j \in J}</m>,
        if the second covering refines the first, then we make one choice of a function <m>f\colon J \to I</m> such that 
        <m>V_j \subseteq U_{f(j)}</m> for all <m>j</m> (the final construction will depend on these choices).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now note that <m>S_1</m> again has a neighborhood basis of cardinality at most <m>\kappa</m>, as then does <m>S_1 \times_S S_1</m>.
        We can thus repeat the construction to obtain a surjection <m>S_2 \to S_1 \times_S S_1</m> and hence a free resolution of <m>S</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In connection with <xref ref="rem-Stone-duality"/>, note that if <m>S</m> is totally disconnected, then <m>S_1 \to S</m> is an isomorphism.
        That is, this construction completes the identification of <m>\Prof</m> with the full subcategory of totally disconnected objects of <m>\CHaus</m>.

          We already know formally that the restriction of this functor to <m>\Prof</m> is fully faithful.

        Another way to interpret <xref ref="prop-compact-hausdorff-in-condensed"/> is to say that
        we can also interpret <m>\CSet</m> as the category of sheaves on <m>\CHaus</m> for the Grothendieck
        topology generated by finite coverings. When working in the context of nonarchimedean analysis/geometry
        the interpretation in terms of <m>\Prof</m> is perhaps more natural; however, one of the points of
        condensed mathematics is to prove access to <em>archimedean</em> analysis/geometry on an equal footing,
        and in the archimedean setting one certainly would like access to test objects like the closed unit interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going further, one even dreams of doing some sort of <em>global</em> analysis/geometry that bridges between
        archimedean and nonarchimedean, and in that context one might like access to even more exotic test objects like the
        idele class group of a number field.

        We factor the forgetful functor <m>\CSet \to \Set</m> through <m>\Top</m> as follows.
        Pick any singleton set <m>*</m> and write the forgetful functor <m>\CSet \to \Set</m> as <m>X \mapsto X(*)</m>.
        Now equip <m>X(*)</m> with the finest topology (i.e., the one with the most open sets)

        For <m>X \in \Prof</m> we formally recover the correct topology on the underlying set.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Denote the functors as <m>F\colon \CSet \to \Top</m> and <m>G\colon \Top \to \CSet</m>.
          The assertion is that for <m>S \in \CSet, X \in \Top</m>,
          there is a natural bijection <m>\Hom_{\Top}(F(S), X) \to \Hom_{\CSet}(S, G(X))</m>

        <p>
          For the first composition, starting with <m>X \in \CSet</m>, for each <m>S \in \Prof</m> we must
          map <m>X(S)</m> to <m>(G \circ F(X))(S) = \Hom_{\Top}(S, F(X))</m>. Given an element of <m>X(S)</m>,
          restriction along inclusions of singletons defines a set-theoretic map <m>S \to F(X)</m>;
          the definition of <m>F</m> ensures that this map is continuous.

          For the second composition, starting with <m>X \in \Top</m>, we have a natural bijection 
          <m>(F \circ G)(X) \to X</m> which we must check is continuous. By the definition of <m>F</m>,
          it suffices to check that precomposing this map with any map out of an object of <m>\Prof</m>
          still yields a continuous map, which follows from the definition of <m>G</m>.
