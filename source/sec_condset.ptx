  <title>Condensed sets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We describe the category of condensed sets.
      This is formally similar to the construction of solid modules, but using the richer category of profinite sets as the test objects.
      As a result, it is able to absorb both the theory of solid modules (see <xref ref="sec_solid_to_condensed"/>) and some nontrivial amount of topology (see
      <xref ref="sec_cohomology"/>).
      However, if you are only interested in solid modules, you can skip forward to <xref ref="sec_solid_completion"/> where we
      continue the discussion of solid modules without the language of condensed sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      From now on, we make the blanket assumption <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m> in the definition of the category <m>\Prof</m>;
      this will correspond to restricting attention to <q>light</q> condensed sets in the terminology of <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-youtube"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: by convention, whenever we write <m>\RR</m> we mean the corresponding object in <m>\Top</m> with the usual archimedean topology.
      In case we mean the underlying set with the discrete topology, we instead write <m>\RR_{\disc}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another convention: I will take <m>\NN</m> (natural numbers) to be the <em>nonnegative</em> integers.
      If I really mean the positive integers (probably because I want to use the multiplicative structure) I will write <m>\NN^\times</m> instead.
      See <xref ref="def-internally-projective-object"/> for the reason I chose this convention.

        Roughly speaking, this amounts to using two separate cardinality cutoffs.

    <title>The category of condensed sets</title>
    <p>
      We now now imitate the passage from modules to solid modules over a ring to pass from sets to condensed sets.
      One important difference is that we do impose certain structure on the functors; this will correspond to enforcing the
      sheaf axiom with respect to a certain topology.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The category of <term>condensed sets</term> is the full subcategory <m>\CSet</m> of <m>\Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Set)</m> consisting of those functors <m>X</m> 
        such that:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>X</m> carries finite disjoint unions to finite products (in particular <m>X(\emptyset)</m> is a singleton set);
          </li>
          <li>
            for every surjection <m>T \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m>, the diagram
            <md>
              X(S) \to X(T) \rightrightarrows X(T \times_S T)
            </md>
            is an equalizer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For any <m>S \in \Prof</m>, the representable functor <m>h_S</m> belongs to <m>\CSet</m> 
        (we will prove a stronger statement in <xref ref="lem-top-space-as-condensed-set"/>).
        By Yoneda's lemma, this yields a fully faithful functor <m>\Prof \to \CSet</m>.
        We will see a bit later that <m>\CSet</m> also contains some other familiar categories
        as full subcategories, including <m>\Set</m> (<xref ref="cor-sets-are-condensed-set"/>),
        <m>\CHaus</m> (<xref ref="prop-compact-hausdorff-in-condensed"/>),
        and even a sizable subcategory of <m>\Top</m> (<xref ref="prop-sequential"/>).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-surjection-of-sheaves">
      <p>
        The compatibilities in the definition of <m>\CSet</m> can be reformulated as the statement that
        we are considering presheaves in sets on <m>\Prof</m> which are sheaves for the following Grothendieck topology:
        a family <m>\{U_i \to S\}_{i \in I}</m> of morphisms is a covering if and only if there is a <em>finite</em> subset <m>J</m> of <m>I</m>
        such that <m>\bigsqcup_{i \in J} U_i \to S</m> is surjective as a morphism in <m>\Top</m>.
        (The point is that this topology is generated by finite disjoint unions and arbitrary surjections.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that we are considering sheaves has a consequence which is standard but worth recalling here:
        while a monomorphism in <m>\CSet</m> is precisely the same thing as a pointwise injection,
        an epimorphism in <m>\CSet</m> is not necessarily a pointwise surjection.
        Rather, a morphism <m>Y \to X</m> in <m>\CSet</m> is an epimorphism if and only if the following weaker condition holds:
        for every <m>S \in \Prof</m>
        and every <m>x \in X(S)</m>, we can find a surjection <m>T \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m> such that
        <m>x</m> lifts to some <m>y \in Y(T)</m>, which need not equalize the maps <m>Y(T) \rightrightarrows Y(T \times_S T)</m>.
        In particular, while the objects of <m>\Prof</m> do formally form a set of compact generators of <m>\CSet</m>,
        they are <em>not projective</em> objects of <m>\CSet</m>.
        (Compare this to <xref ref="prop-formal-compact-generators"/>, where there is no sheafification involved.)
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, at some point I will start referring to monomorphisms and epimorphisms in <m>\CSet</m>
        as <q>injections</q> and <q>surjections</q>. Do not read too much into this!
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-evaluate-condensed-at-singleton">
      <p>
        Evaluation at a fixed singleton in <m>\Prof</m> defines a functor <m>\CSet \to \Set</m>,
        which we will denote by <m>X \mapsto X(*)</m>.
        We will interpret this as an <q>underlying set</q> construction, although this should be interpreted carefully
        as the functor is <em>not</em> faithful; that is, one cannot view condensed sets as <q>sets with extra structure</q>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-prof-to-cset-does-not-preserve-colimits">
      <p>
        The functor <m>\Prof \to \CSet</m> does not preserve colimits.
        For example, any object of <m>\Prof</m> can be viewed as a colimit over its closed subspaces of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>,
        and this remains valid in <m>\Top</m>,
        but this description no longer applies in <m>\CSet</m>.

      Before proceeding, we first enrich our collection of examples of condensed sets.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-top-space-as-condensed-set">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any <m>X \in \Top</m>, the assignment  <m>X(S) = \Hom_{\Top}(S, X)</m> 
          (i.e., the restriction of the representable functor <m>h_X</m> 
          from <m>\Top</m> to <m>\Prof</m>) defines an object <m>\underline{X}</m> of <m>\CSet</m>.
          (Warning: we may sometimes forget the underline.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The only issue is to check the compatibilities in the definition of <m>\CSet</m>.
          Compatibility with disjoint unions is clear because disjoint unions in <m>\Top</m> are coproducts.
          For compatibility with surjections, note that this is obvious at the level of sets, and we can use 
          <xref ref="lem-every-surjection-in-CHaus-is-quotient"/> to promote the conculsion to <m>\Top</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-sets-are-condensed-set">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the functor <m>\Set \to \Top</m> promoting a set to a discrete topological space
          (i.e., the left adjoint to the forgetful functor <m>\Top \to \Set</m>).
          Then the composition <m>\Set \to \Top \to \CSet \to \Set</m> is naturally equivalent to the identity;
          hence <m>\Set \to \Top \to \CSet</m> is fully faithful.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The composition <m>\Set \to \Top \to \CSet</m> carries <m>X</m> to the functor taking <m>S \in \Prof</m>
          to <m>\Hom_{\Top}(S, X)</m>, which is the set of closed-open partitions of <m>S</m> 
          indexed by <em>finite</em> subsets of <m>X</m>.
          Hence for any <m>X,Y \in \Set</m>, any natural transformation between
          the functors <m>S \mapsto \Hom_{\Top}(S, X)</m> and <m>S \mapsto \Hom_{\Top}(S, Y)</m> on <m>\Prof</m>
          can be reconstructed from its effect on all singletons, or equivalently on one singleton.

      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark xml:id="rem-interpret-sequential-limits">
      <p>
        It is worth noting that there is no cardinality cutoff in <xref ref="cor-sets-are-condensed-set"/>.
        That is, <m>\CSet</m> contains the entire category <m>\Set</m> as a full subcategory;
        the effect of the cardinality cutoff is only felt in <q>topological</q> ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, in light of <xref ref="exa-one-point-compactification-of-N"/>, we have the object <m>\NN_\infty \in \Prof</m>,
        at which we can then evaluate any condensed set. 
        For an object <m>X \in \Top</m>, 
        this gives the collection of <q>limited</q> convergent sequences in <m>X</m> (i.e., if <m>X</m> is not Hausdorff we must
        specify a choice of the limit); we thus obtain an arrow-theoretic interpretation of sequential convergence.
        In particular, this test object can distinguish an object of <m>\Top</m> from its underlying set viewed as a discrete topological space.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, since we are now assuming <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m> we will have no comparable construction to study
        convergence of larger nets. This will then limit the extent to which topological spaces embed into <m>\CSet</m>,
        but not to an extent that will impede our work (<xref ref="prop-sequential" />).

      Here is a key example of a condensed set not in the essential image of <m>\Top</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-difference-on-product-is-locally-constant">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>T \to S</m> be a surjection in <m>\Prof</m>. For any abelian group <m>X</m>, if <m>f\colon T \to X</m>
          is a map of sets such that the difference between the two induced maps <m>f_1, f_2\colon T \times_S T \to X</m> is locally constant,
          then <m>f</m> is the sum of a locally constant map plus a map that factors through <m>S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By hypothesis we have a finite covering of <m>T \times_S T</m> such that <m>f_1-f_2</m> is constant on each term.
          Since the topology on <m>T \times_S T</m> is generated by products <m>U_1 \times_S U_2</m> where <m>U_j \subseteq T</m> is closed-open,
          we may assume our covering is given by closed-open subsets of this form. 
          We can then choose a finite partition <m>\{V_i\}_{i \in I}</m>
          of <m>T</m> such that every <m>U_j</m> is a finite union of some of the <m>V_i</m>.
          We can further refine this partition to ensure that the images of the <m>V_i</m> in <m>S</m> form a covering by closed-open subsets which is then refined by some finite partition;
          since our desired conclusion may be checked locally on <m>S</m>, we may reduce to the case where each <m>V_i</m> surjects onto <m>S</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, for any <m>i,j \in I</m>, <m>V_i \times_S V_j</m> is nonempty and <m>f_1 - f_2</m> is constant on <m>V_i \times_S V_j</m>;
          let <m>c_{ij} \in X</m> denote this constant value.
          By the same token, for any <m>i,j,k \in I</m>, <m>V_i \times_S V_j \times_S V_k</m> is nonempty and so
          <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-difference-on-product-cocycle">
            c_{ik} = c_{ij} + c_{jk}
          </md>.
          Now choose an index <m>i_0 \in I</m> and define a locally constant function <m>g \colon T \to X</m>
          by specifying that <m>g(t_i) = c_{ii_0}</m> for all <m>t_i \in V_i</m>.
          By construction, for any <m>(t_i, t_j) \in V_i \times_S V_j</m>, using <xref ref="eq-difference-on-product-cocycle"/> we find that
          <md>
              g(t_i) - g(t_j) = c_{ii_0} - c_{ji_0} = c_{ij} = f(t_i) - f(t_j)
          </md>.
          Consequently, <m>h := f - g</m> factors through <m>S</m>.

    <example xml:id="exa-quotient-of-r-by-discrete">
      <p>
        Let <m>F \in \Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Set)</m> be the functor taking <m>S</m> to the quotient
        of the group of continuous maps <m>S \to \RR</m> by the subgroup of locally constant maps.
        It is clear that this is compatible with finite disjoint unions.
        To check compatibility with a surjection <m>T \to S</m>, we must check that if <m>f\colon T \to \RR</m>
        is continuous and the two maps <m>f_1, f_2\colon T \times_S T \to \RR</m> differ by a locally constant map,
        then <m>f</m> can be written as a locally constant map plus a map that factors through <m>S</m> (which will then
        necessarily be continuous); this follows from <xref ref="lem-difference-on-product-is-locally-constant"/>.

      <p>
        When <m>S</m> is a singleton, we have <m>F(S) = \{0\}</m>,
        so if <m>F</m> were in the essential image of <m>\Top</m> it would arise from a singleton space.
        However, we can compute some other evaluations to see that this is far from what is going on.

      <ul>
        <li>
          For <m>S = \NN_\infty</m>, <m>F(S)</m> consists of convergent sequences modulo eventually constant sequences,

        <li>
          For <m>S = \{0,1\}^\NN</m>, we can produce a nontrivial element of <m>F(S)</m> using the

            (s_1, s_2, \dots) \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^\infty (2s_n) 3^{-n}

    <title>Free resolutions of topological spaces</title>
    <p>
      While by definition one can only evaluate condensed sets on test objects in the category of profinite sets,
      we can use the functor <m>\Top \to \CSet</m> to evaluate condensed sets on arbitrary topological spaces.
      To quantify the extent to which this retains information from <m>\Top</m>, we use the following concept.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        By a <term>free resolution</term> of an object <m>S \in \CHaus</m>, we will mean a coequalizer diagram of the form
        <md>
          S_2 \rightrightarrows S_1 \to S
        </md>
        in which <m>S_1, S_2 \in \Prof</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given such a diagram, for any <m>X \in \CSet</m> we can define the evaluation <m>X(S)</m> as an equalizer:
        <md>
          X(S) \to X(S_1) \rightrightarrows X(S_2)
        </md>.
        By construction, this reproduces the previous definition when <m>X \in \Prof</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-construct-profinite-cover">
      <p>
        For any <m>S \in \CHaus</m>, we can form a surjection <m>S_1 \to S</m> with <m>S_1 \in \Prof</m> by taking an inverse limit over finite coverings
        by compact neighborhoods in some countable basis.
        More precisely, for any two finite coverings <m>\{U_i\}_{i \in I}</m> and <m>\{V_j\}_{j \in J}</m>,
        if the second covering refines the first, then we make one choice of a function <m>f\colon J \to I</m> such that 
        <m>V_j \subseteq U_{f(j)}</m> for all <m>j</m> (the final construction will depend on these choices).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now note that <m>S_1</m> also belongs to <m>\CHaus</m> (it again has a countable neighborhood basis),
        as then does the fiber product <m>S_1 \times_S S_1</m> (as a closed subset of the absolute product).
        We can thus repeat the construction to obtain a surjection <m>S_2 \to S_1 \times_S S_1</m> and hence a free resolution of <m>S</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In connection with <xref ref="rem-Stone-duality"/>, note that if <m>S</m> is totally disconnected, then <m>S_1 \to S</m> is an isomorphism.
        That is, this construction completes the identification of <m>\Prof</m> with the full subcategory of totally disconnected objects of <m>\CHaus</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-cover-interval-by-Cantor-set">
      <p>
        Using binary representations we get a surjection from the abstract Cantor set <m>S_1 := \{0,1\}^n</m> to the closed interval <m>S := [0,1]</m>.
        Explicitly, this is the map <m>(s_1,s_2,\dots) \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^\infty s_n 2^{-n}</m>.
        This map is bijective over all points except dyadic rationals in <m>(0,1)</m>, whose fibers consist of two points.
        We can thus write <m>S_1 \times_S S_1</m> as a copy of the diagonal <m>S_1</m> plus two copies of <m>(0,1) \cap \ZZ[\tfrac{1}{2}]</m>,
        topologized in a certain way that makes the whole thing compact. The result can in turn be covered by one copy of <m>S_1</m> (to cover the diagonal)
        and two copies of <m>[0,1]</m> (to cover the remaining points together with their accumulation points on the diagonal), or in turn by three copies of <m>S_1</m>.

        Another way to interpret <xref ref="prop-compact-hausdorff-in-condensed"/> is to say that
        we can also interpret <m>\CSet</m> as the category of sheaves on <m>\CHaus</m> for the Grothendieck
        topology generated by finite coverings. When working in the context of nonarchimedean analysis/geometry
        the interpretation in terms of <m>\Prof</m> is perhaps more natural; however, one of the points of
        condensed mathematics is to prove access to <em>archimedean</em> analysis/geometry on an equal footing,
        and in the archimedean setting one certainly would like access to test objects like the closed unit interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going further, one even dreams of doing some sort of <em>global</em> analysis/geometry that bridges between
        archimedean and nonarchimedean, and in that context one might like access to even more exotic test objects like the
        idele class group of a number field.

        If the underlying set of <m>S</m> has cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>,

    <title>Condensed sets and topological spaces</title>
    <definition xml:id="def-functor-cset-top">
      <p>
        We factor the forgetful functor <m>\CSet \to \Set</m> through <m>\Top</m> as follows.
        Pick any singleton set <m>*</m> and write the forgetful functor <m>\CSet \to \Set</m> as <m>X \mapsto X(*)</m>.
        Now equip <m>X(*)</m> with the finest topology (i.e., the one with the most open sets)
        such that for any <m>S \in \Prof</m> and any element of <m>X(S)</m>,
        the resulting map <m>S \cong S(*) \to X(*)</m> is continuous as a map of topological spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>X \in \Prof</m> we formally recover the correct topology on the underlying set.
        Using <xref ref="rem-construct-profinite-cover"/> we may upgrade this conclusion to cover <m>X \in \CHaus</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This construction can be viewed as starting with the embedding <m>\Prof \to \Top</m> and then making a left Kan extension to <m>\CSet</m>.
        One thing that makes this interesting is colimits in <m>\Top</m> and <m>\CSet</m> may disagree (<xref ref="rem-prof-to-cset-does-not-preserve-colimits"/>).
        A consequence of this will be that <m>\Top \to \CSet</m> is not fully faithful.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, <m>\Top \to \CSet</m> will become fully faithful if we restrict to <q>small enough</q> topological spaces (<xref ref="prop-sequential"/>). 
        Among other things, this will provide a mechanism by which condensed sets
        detect some sophisticated invariants of algebraic topology; see <xref ref="sec_cohomology"/>.
      </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-cset-to-top-left-adjoint">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The functor <m>\CSet \to \Top</m> from <xref ref="def-functor-cset-top"/> is <em>left</em> adjoint to the functor
          <m>\Top \to \CSet</m> from <xref ref="lem-top-space-as-condensed-set"/>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Denote the functors as <m>F\colon \CSet \to \Top</m> and <m>G\colon \Top \to \CSet</m>.
          The assertion is that for <m>S \in \CSet, X \in \Top</m>,
          there is a natural bijection <m>\Hom_{\Top}(F(S), X) \to \Hom_{\CSet}(S, G(X))</m>
          specified by a pair of natural transformations <m>\id \to G \circ F</m>, <m>F \circ G \to \id</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first composition, starting with <m>X \in \CSet</m>, for each <m>S \in \Prof</m> we must
          map <m>X(S)</m> to <m>(G \circ F(X))(S) = \Hom_{\Top}(S, F(X))</m>. Given an element of <m>X(S)</m>,
          restriction along inclusions of singletons defines a set-theoretic map <m>S \to F(X)</m>;
          the definition of <m>F</m> ensures that this map is continuous.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the second composition, starting with <m>X \in \Top</m>, we have a natural bijection 
          <m>(F \circ G)(X) \to X</m> which we must check is continuous. By the definition of <m>F</m>,
          it suffices to check that precomposing this map with any map out of an object of <m>\Prof</m>
          still yields a continuous map, which follows from the definition of <m>G</m>.

    <remark xml:id="rem-cset-to-top-does-not-commute-with-products">
      <p>
        Note that the adjunction in <xref ref="prop-cset-to-top-left-adjoint"/> is reversed from what might naively expect.
        A related point is that the functor <m>\CSet \to \Top</m> does not commute with products;
        this will come back to haunt us when we start considering algebraic structures on condensed sets, as in <xref ref="sec_condab"/>.

    <title>Sequential topological spaces</title>
    <p>
      We next identify the topological spaces which we can view faithfully as condensed sets.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-sequential">
      <p>
        A space <m>X \in \Top</m> is <term>first countable</term> if every point has a countable neighborhood basis.
        By contrast, <m>X</m> is <term>second countable</term> if <m>X</m> itself has a countable neighborhood basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space <m>X</m> is <term>sequential</term> if every subset of <m>X</m> which is <term>sequentially closed</term>
        (i.e., contains the limit of any convergent sequence with terms in the subset) is actually closed.
        An equivalent condition is that <m>X</m> can be written as a quotient of a first countable space
        (although in practice all reasonable examples are already first countable).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Top^{\seq}</m> denote the full subcategory of <m>\Top</m> consisting of sequential spaces.
        This contains <m>\CHaus</m> as a full subcategory by the definition of the latter.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-sequential">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The restriction of the composition <m>\Top \to \CSet \to \Top</m> to sequential spaces is an equivalence.
          Consequently, we have a fully faithful functor <m>\Top^{\seq} \to \CSet</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The composition <m>\Top \to \CSet \to \Top</m> induces a canonical equivalence at the level of underlying sets,
          so it suffices to check that the topology does not change when we start with a sequential space.
          This follows from the fact that a map between sequential topological spaces is continuous if and only if it is sequentially continuous.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-sequential-limits-of-surjections">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a sequential inverse system <m>\varprojlim_{n \in \NN} X_n</m> in <m>\CSet</m> with limit <m>X</m> whose transition maps are epimorphisms,
          and a compatible family of epimorphisms <m>X_n \to Y</m>, the induced map <m>X \to Y</m> is an epimorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As per <xref ref="rem-surjection-of-sheaves"/>, we need to know that for any <m>S\in \Prof</m> and any <m>y \in Y(S)</m>,
          we can find a surjection <m>T \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m> such that <m>y</m> lifts to some <m>x \in X(T)</m>.
          To begin with, <m>X_1 \to Y</m> is an epimorphism and so we can find a surjection <m>T_1 \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m> such that <m>y</m>
          lifts to some <m>x_1 \in X_1(T_1)</m>. We can then find a surjection <m>T_2 \to T_1</m> such that <m>x_1</m> lifts to some <m>x_2 \in X_2(T_2)</m>.
          Repeating, we obtain an inverse system <m>\varprojlim_{n \in \NN} T_n</m> in <m>\Prof</m>
          such that <m>y</m> admits a compatible sequence of lifts to <m>X_n(T_n)</m> for each <m>n</m>. 
          This inverse system formally admits a limit <m>T \in \Prof</m> such that <m>y</m> lifts to some <m>x \in X(T)</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>n \in \NN</m>, let <m>X_n \to Y_n</m> be an epimorphism in <m>\CSet</m>.
          Then <m>\prod_{n \in \NN} X_n \to \prod_{n \in \NN} Y_n</m> is also an epimorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Apply <xref ref="prop-sequential-limits-of-surjections"/> to the inverse system
          <md>
            \prod_{n' \lt n+1} X_{n'} \times \prod_{n' \geq n+1} Y_{n'} \to \prod_{n' \lt n} X_{n'} \times \prod_{n' \geq n} Y_{n'}
            \qquad (n=1,2,\dots)
          </md>
          and the identity map out of the last term.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="prop-sequential-limits-of-surjections"/> cannot be weakened to omit the condition that the transition maps are epimorphisms.
        This can be seen using an example based on discrete sets; for instance, 
        let <m>Y</m> be a singleton set; set <m>X_n = \{n, n+1, \dots\}</m>;
        and form the inverse system <m>\varprojlim_{n \in \NN} X_n</m> using the inclusions <m>X_{n+1} \to X_n</m>
        (which has empty inverse limit).
