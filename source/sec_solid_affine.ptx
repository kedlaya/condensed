  <title>Solid analytic rings and Huber pairs</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this lecture, we consider the solid analogue of the affine line over <m>\ZZ</m>.
      In particular, we will obtain a new analytic ring in the sense of <xref ref="def-analytic-ring"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As noted at the end of <xref ref="def-solid-topological-groups"/>, we can interpret solid abelian groups
      as a subcategory of (sequential) topological abelian groups, and this is the point of view that lines up best with the
      examples we will consider in this lecture. We thus adopt that viewpoint here, keeping in mind that we will occasionally need to shift our frame of reference.

  <subsection>
    <title>Some solid rings</title>
    <p>
      We first observe that a number of familiar topological rings are in fact solid (in the sense that their underlying groups are solid).
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Equip the ring <m>\ZZ \llbracket T \rrbracket</m> with the <m>T</m>-adic topology.
        The underlying object of <m>\TopAb</m> is then solid: it corresponds to <m>\prod_\NN \ZZ_\solid \in \Ab_\solid</m>.
        We may thus view it as a ring object in <m>\TopAb_\solid</m>, and the homomorphism <m>\ZZ[T] \to \ZZ \llbracket T \rrbracket</m>
        (for the discrete topology on <m>\ZZ[T]</m>) is a morphism of ring objects in <m>\TopAb_\solid</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the same token, <m>\ZZ \llbracket T_1 ,\dots, T_n \rrbracket</m> equipped with the <m>(T_1,\dots,T_n)</m>-adic topology is a ring object in <m>\TopAb_\solid</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Equip <m>\ZZ_p \cong \ZZ \llbracket T \rrbracket/(T-p)</m> with the <m>p</m>-adic topology.
        This gives yet another ring object in <m>\TopAb_\solid</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equip <m>\QQ_p = \ZZ_p[1/p]</m> with its usual topology, which we can view as the direct limit topology on
        <me>
          \colim \left( \ZZ_{p} \stackrel{\times p}{\to} \ZZ_{p} \stackrel{\times p}{\to} \cdots \right).
        </me>
        This is also a ring object in <m>\TopAb_\solid</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        We have
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \QQ_{p} \otimes_\solid \ZZ \llbracket T \rrbracket &amp;= (\ZZ_{p} \otimes_{\solid} \ZZ \llbracket T \rrbracket)[1/p] 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp;= \left(\left(\ZZ\llbracket T_1 \rrbracket/(T_1-p) \right) \otimes \ZZ \llbracket T_2 \rrbracket \right)[1/p]
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; = \left( \ZZ\llbracket T_1, T_2 \rrbracket/(T_1-p) \right)[1/p]
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; = \ZZ_p \llbracket T \rrbracket[1/p]
          </mrow>
        </md>
        where we equip <m>\ZZ_p \llbracket T \rrbracket</m> with the <m>(p,T)</m>-adic topology.
        We observe that <m>\QQ_{p} \otimes_\solid \ZZ \llbracket T \rrbracket </m> injects into <m>\QQ_p \llbracket T \rrbracket</m> but is much smaller; 
        it consists of the power series with bounded coefficients,
        which can also be interpreted as the bounded rigid-analytic functions on the open unit disc over <m>\QQ_p</m>.
      </p>

    <title>A new analytic ring</title>
      <p>
        We previously induced the notion of an <term>analytic ring</term> (<xref ref="def-analytic-ring"/>),
        as a condensed ring equipped with a certain subcategory of the modules over a ring,
        constrained in a such a way that solid abelian groups provide an example.
        We describe a new example here, meant to capture the geometry of the <em>closed</em> unit disc.
      </p>
      <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)</m> denote the category of <m>\ZZ[T]</m>-module objects in <m>\TopAb_\solid</m>.
        We say that <m>M \in \Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)</m>  is <term><m>T</m>-solid</term>, or for short <term><m>T</m>-solid</term>,
        if multiplication by <m>1-TU</m> induces an isomorphism on <m>\Hom_{\TopAb_\solid}(\ZZ \llbracket U \rrbracket, M)</m>.
        Equivalently, the map <m>1 - T \sigma</m> on <m>\Hom_{\TopAb}(P, M)</m> is an isomorphism
        for <m>P</m> as in <xref ref="def-internally-projective-object"/>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p> 
          The full subcategory of <m>T</m>-solid objects of <m>\Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)</m> is closed under kernels, cokernels, limits, colimits, and extensions.
          Moreover, for any <m>M,N \in \Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)</m>, if <m>N</m> is <m>T</m>-solid, then so are <m>\iHom_{\Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)}(M, N)</m>
          and <m>\iExt^i_{\Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)}(M,N)</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
          Consequently, the pair consisting of <m>\ZZ[T]</m> and the <m>T</m>-solid objects of <m>\Mod_{\ZZ[T]}(\TopAb_\solid)</m>, viewed as objects of <m>\CAb</m>,
          form an analytic ring.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As in <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>, everything follows pretty formally from the definition.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      <p>
        By interpreting
        <me>
          \ZZ((T^{-1})) = \ZZ\llbracket U \rrbracket[T]/(TU-1) = \coker(\times TU-1\colon \ZZ \llbracket U \rrbracket[T] \to \ZZ \llbracket U \rrbracket[T])
        </me>
        we see that this object has <m>T</m>-solidification zero; the definition was carefully crafted to enforce this.
