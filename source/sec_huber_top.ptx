    <title>Whither the Zariski topology?</title>
    <p>
      As a warmup, let us think carefully about how one might arrive at the Zariski topology on an affine scheme,
      or better as a Grothendieck topology on the category of affine schemes, given that one wants to end up reconstructing the usual theory of schemes.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        By Yoneda's lemma, a scheme <m>X</m> can be reconstructed from its <term>functor of points</term>, i.e., the functor <m>S \to \Hom_{\Sch}(S,X)</m> on <m>\Sch</m>.
        Since every scheme is covered by affine schemes, it is enough to use the restriction of this functor to the category of affine schemes, which is equivalent
        to the opposite category of rings. In fact the term <term>scheme</term> is meant to suggest this: a scheme is a <q>blueprint</q> for turning rings into
        sets carrying some meaningful algebro-geometric structure.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-map-to-P1">
      <p>
        Let us spell out the functor of points for mapping a test scheme <m>X</m> into <m>X \to \PP^1_\ZZ</m>.
        Since we have the canonical line bundle <m>\calO(1)</m> on <m>\PP^1_\ZZ</m>, <m>f^* \calO(1)</m> is a line bundle on <m>X</m>.
        If we write <m>\PP^1_\ZZ = \Proj \ZZ[s_0, s_1]</m>, then the two sections <m>s_0, s_1</m> of <m>\calO(1)</m> pull back to sections of <m>f^* \calO(1)</m>
        which generate this bundle.
        We can then reconstruct <m>f</m> uniquely from the data of the line bundle <m>f^* \calO(1)</m> and the sections <m>f^*(s_0), f^*(s_1)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put another way, the data of the map <m>f</m> is equivalent to the data of the short exact sequence of sheaves of <m>\calO_X</m>-modules
        <me>
          0 \to \calL_1 \to \calO_X \oplus \calO_X \to \calL_0 \to 0
        </me>
        in which <m>\calL_0</m> is invertible: the bundle <m>\calL_0</m> corresponds to <m>f^* \calO(1)</m> and the two maps <m>\calO_X \to \calL_0</m>
        correspond to the two sections <m>f^*(s_0), f^*(s_1)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>X = \Spec R</m> is an affine scheme, we can again replace the data with a short exact sequence of <m>R</m>-modules:
        <me>
          0 \to L_1 \to R \oplus R \to L_0 \to 0
        </me>
        in which <m>L_0</m> is <term>invertible</term> (projective of rank 1). In particular, this functor can be described in terms of the category of <m>R</m>-modules,
        which is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves on <m>X</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose we want to think of <m>\PP^1_\ZZ</m> as itself being built out of the two affine schemes <m>\Spec \ZZ[s_1/s_0]</m> and <m>\Spec \ZZ[s_0/s_1]</m>.
        We then have to cover <m>\Spec R</m> with two localizations corresponding to the subsets on which <m>s_0</m> and <m>s_1</m> are respectively nonzero.
        If <m>L_0</m> is trivial, then we can identify <m>s_0</m> and <m>s_1</m> with elements of <m>R</m> that generate the unit ideal
        and take the maps
        <me>
          \Spec R[T]/(s_1 T - s_0) \to \Spec R, \qquad \Spec R[T]/(s_0 T - s_1) \to \Spec R
        </me>.
        The analogue in the general case is to convert <m>R \oplus R \to L_0</m> into the closed immersion
        <me>
          \Spec R = \Proj_R \Sym_R(L_0) \to \Proj_R \Sym_R(R \oplus R) = \PP^1_R
        </me>,
        take the fiber product with the inclusion of one of the basic open subsets <m>\Spec R[T]</m> corresponding to dehomogenizing <m>\Sym_R(R \oplus R) \cong R[T_0, T_1]</m>
        (i.e., mapping one variable to <m>T</m> and the other to 1), and then project via <m>\PP^1_R \to \Spec R</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The key role played in <xref ref="exa-map-to-P1"/> by the category of coherent sheaves on <m>X</m> is perhaps not surprising.
        After all, for a ring <m>R</m>, every affine scheme over <m>\Spec R</m> can be interpreted as an <m>R</m>-algebra object in <m>\QCoh(\Spec R)</m>.
        By the same token, building a satisfactory theory of quasicoherent sheaves on analytic rings will be crucial to the development of analytic stacks.

    <p>
      It may not be readily apparent that <xref ref="exa-map-to-P1"/> tells us <em>everything</em> we need to know to make Zariski coverings of affine schemes, but that is in fact the case.

    <definition xml:id="def-standard-binary-covering-Zariski">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative ring, define a <term>standard binary covering</term> of <m>\Spec R</m> to be a covering of the form

        for some <m>f,g \in R</m> generating the unit ideal. In particular there must exist <m>a,b \in R</m> with <m>af + bg = 1</m>,
        so <m>\frac{1}{g} = a\tfrac{f}{g}+b</m> and so <m>R\left[\tfrac{f}{g}\right] = R\left[ \tfrac{1}{g} \right]</m>;
        consequently, <m>\Spec R\left[\tfrac{f}{g}\right] \to \Spec R</m> induces an isomorphism

        In scheme theory, it is obvious that a distinguished open subspace of a distinguished open subspace is again a distinguished open subspace.
        That is, if I start with a ring <m>R</m>, an element <m>f \in R</m>, and a second element <m>g \in R[\tfrac{1}{f}]</m>,
        then <m>\Spec R[\tfrac{1}{f}][\tfrac{1}{g}] \to \Spec R</m> induces an isomorphism onto <m>U_{h}</m> for some <m>h \in R</m>; namely,
        write <m>g = g_1/f</m> and take <m>h := fg_1</m>.

        The situation is a bit more complicated for Huber rings;

    <proposition xml:id="prop-standard-binary-coverings">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Zariski topology on the category <m>\Ring^{\op}</m> (i.e., the category of affine schemes)
          is generated by standard binary coverings.
          (Note: by convention, we consider the empty covering of the empty space to be <q>generated</q> by any collection.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>R \in \Ring</m>, we have a basis of the Zariski topology on <m>\Spec R</m> given by the open subsets <m>U_{f} = \Spec R[\tfrac{1}{f}]</m>
          for <m>f \in R</m>. Given an open covering by <m>U_{f_i}</m> for some <m>f_i \in R</m>, the ideal generated by the <m>f_i</m> must not be contained in any prime ideal,
          or even any maximal ideal, so it must be the unit ideal; we can thus find some finite subset <m>f_1,\dots,f_n</m> of the <m>f_i</m> such that the original covering
          is refined by the covering by <m>U_{f_1},\dots,U_{f_n}</m>, and some <m>a_1,\dots,a_n \in R</m> such that <m>a_1 f_1 + \cdots + a_n f_n = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prove by induction on <m>n</m> that this covering is refined by some covering generated by standard binary coverings.
          When <m>n=1</m>, <m>f_1</m> must be a unit and so we are considering the one-element covering, which we may ignore.
          When <m>n=2</m>, we have <m>U_{a_1 f_1} \subseteq U_{f_1}</m>, <m>U_{a_2 f_2} \subseteq U_{f_2}</m> and so
          the covering is refined by the standard binary covering defined by <m>a_1 f_1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>n \gt 2</m>, set
          <me>
            g := a_1 f_1 + \cdots + a_{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} = 1 - a_{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor+1} f_{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} - \cdots - a_n f_n
          </me>
          so that <m>V_1 := \Spec R[\tfrac{1}{g}]</m>, <m>V_2 := \Spec R[\tfrac{1}{1-g}]</m> form a standard binary covering of <m>\Spec R</m>.
          In the ring <m>R[\tfrac{1}{g}]</m>, the elements <m>f_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor</m> generate the unit ideal;
          in the ring <m>R[\tfrac{1}{1-g}]</m>, the elements <m>f_i</m> for <m>\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1 \leq i \leq n</m> generate the unit ideal.
          Consequently, the original covering is refined by the covering by
          <me>
            \Spec R[\tfrac{1}{g}][\tfrac{1}{f_i}] \quad (i=1,\dots,\lfloor n/2 \rfloor), \quad
            \Spec R[\tfrac{1}{1-g}][\tfrac{1}{f_i}] \quad (i=\lfloor n/2 \rfloor+1, \dots,n)
          </me>.
          Since both <m>\lfloor n/2 \rfloor</m> and <m>n - \lfloor n/2 \rfloor</m> are strictly less than <m>n</m>, we may apply the induction hypothesis to
          conclude.

    <title>Rational localizations of Huber pairs</title>
    <p>
      We next recall the construction of localization maps in Huber's theory, in the language of solid analytic rings.
      We first provide some context from the previous discussion.
      (We will introduce further context when we discuss <term>analytification</term> more thoroughly in <xref ref="subsec-analytification"/>).
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-maps-to-P1-huber">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a ring, we can formally reinterpret maps from <m>\Spec R</m> to <m>\PP^1_\ZZ</m> as maps from <m>\Spec R</m> to <m>\PP^1_R = \PP^1_\ZZ \times_\ZZ R</m>
        in the category of schemes over <m>\Spec R</m>.
        For <m>R</m> an analytic ring, we will want to consider maps from its associated geometric object to the analytic projective line over <m>R</m>,
        which means we should be able to pull back coverings of the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Huber pairs (or more generally solid analytic rings), we will want there to be a covering of the analytic projective line by two subspaces defined by the conditions
        <m>|s_0| \leq |s_1|</m> and <m>|s_1| \leq |s_0|</m>, corresponding in complex geometry to the covering of the Riemann sphere by the closed unit disc and its reciprocal.
        As for schemes (<xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings"/>), this desire turns out to force the entire topology of adic spectra (<xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      In order to explain <xref ref="rem-maps-to-P1-huber"/>, we first construct the analogue of localization maps <m>R \to R_f</m> for complete Huber pairs,
      and more generally for solid condensed rings.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-solid-Tate">
      <p>
        Following <xref ref="exa-solid-Tate-algebra"/>, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, define the <term>solid Tate algebra</term> 
        <m>\underline{\ZZ}\langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m> over <m>\underline{\ZZ}</m> as the solid condensed ring corresponding to the functor in <m>\Ab_\solid</m> given by
        <me>
          \prod_I \ZZ_\solid \mapsto \left( \prod_I \ZZ[T_1,\dots,T_n] \right) \cap \left( \bigoplus_I \ZZ \right) \llbracket T_1,\dots,T_n \rrbracket

      <p>
        For any solid condensed ring <m>R</m>, set <m>R \langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle := R \otimes_\solid \underline{\ZZ} \langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m>.
        When <m>R</m> is the solid ring associated to a Tate Huber ring, this coincides with the usual definition of the Tate algebra
        (the ring of power series whose coefficients form a null sequence) by some computations as in <xref ref="exa-solid-Tate-algebra"/>
        and <xref ref="exa-solid-Tate-algebra2"/>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-liquefaction-is-Tate-algebra">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a solid condensed ring admitting a topologically nilpotent unit <m>q \in R^{\circ \circ} \cap R(*)^\times</m>.
          Then 
          <me>

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It suffices to check the case <m>n=1</m> and then induct; that is, we must check that

            R[T]_{\liquid T} \cong R \langle T \rangle

          This further reduces to the universal case <m>R = \underline{\ZZ((q))}</m> for the <m>q</m>-adic topology on <m>\ZZ((q))</m>.
          As noted in <xref ref="def-solid-Tate"/>, we may identify <m>R \langle T \rangle</m> with the usual notion of the Tate algebra over
          the Huber ring <m>\ZZ((q))</m>, and then it is straightforward to compare the two.

    <remark xml:id="rem-discrete-liquefy">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="lem-liquefaction-is-Tate-algebra"/>, the hypothesis that <m>A</m> admits a topologically nilpotent unit is indeed necessary.
        For instance, for <m>A = \underline{\ZZ}</m>, <m>A[T]_{\liquid T} = \underline{\ZZ[T]}</m> for the discrete topology,
        which is not equal to <m>\ZZ \langle T \rangle</m> as per <xref ref="exa-solid-Tate-algebra"/>.
        The point is that in this case, the passage from <m>A[T]</m> to <m>A[T]_{\liquid T}</m> is not sensitive enough
        to distinguish between <m>\underline{\ZZ}[T]</m> and <m>\underline{\ZZ} \langle T \rangle</m>.

        or of the solid analytic ring <m>A</m>.

      <p>
        For comparison with Huber's theory, we will also need to consider the case where <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g</m> generate an ideal whose radical contains <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m>.

      <p>
        The distinction between rational localizations and weak rational localizations collapses 
        when <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> contains a topologically nilpotent unit, 
        or more generally if <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> generates the unit ideal of <m>A</m>.
        An example where the two concepts differ would be with <m>A^{\triangleright} = \ZZ[x,y]</m> with the <m>(x,y)</m>-adic topology and the parameters <m>x,y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One reason for using weak rational localizations is that they have better behavior with respect to composition;
        see <xref ref="rem-compose-rational-localizations"/>. However, rational localizations are enough to generate the right topology,
        and it is somewhat easier to analyze coverings made solely of rational localizations; so we will prefer them in what follows.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-compose-rational-localizations">
      <p>
        In contrast with <xref ref="rem-compose-distinguished"/>, it is not clear that a composition <m>A \to B \to C</m> of rational localizations is a rational localization.
        One issue is that the parameters defining <m>B \to C</m> do not belong to <m>A</m>, but this is easily remedied by replacing them with suitable approximations in
        <m>A[\tfrac{1}{g}]</m> and then clearing denominators. A much more serious issue is that the resulting parameters do not generate the unit ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For weak rational localizations of a Huber ring, the composition is again a weak rational localization 
        (<xref ref="bib-Huber2"/>, Lemma 1.5(ii)); as a corollary, if <m>A \to B</m> and <m>A \to C</m> are weak rational localizations, then the composition
        <m>A \to B \to B \otimes_A C</m> is again a weak rational localization.
        However, these arguments depend on the fact that a Huber ring contains a finitely generated ideal of definition, 
        a property which has no analogue for solid analytic rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, we will formulate a more intrinsic version of the rational localization property that will be automatically compatible with compositions,
        that of an <term>idempotent morphism</term> (<xref ref="def-idempotent-morphism"/>).

        When constructing a rational localization using <xref ref="prop-solid-rational-localization"/> starting with a Tate Huber pair <m>A</m>
        (more precisely, with an element of the essential image of the functor
        <xref ref="prop-Huber-pair-to-solid-analytic"/>), it can still happen that the resulting solid analytic ring 
        <m>A^{\triangleright} \left\langle \tfrac{f_1}{g}, \dots, \tfrac{f_n}{g}\right\rangle</m> is not a Huber pair!
        The issue is that to get the object in the category of Huber pairs with the corresponding universal property, one must take the <em>completion</em>
        of the ideal <m>(f_1 - gT_1,\dots,f_n  - gT_n)</m> as this ideal may itself not be closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This failure turns out to be intimately related to the failure of general Tate Huber rings to be <term>sheafy</term>.
        We will discuss this in some detail in <xref ref="sec_huber_local"/>;
        see especially <xref ref="prop-sheafy-by-localizations-are-Huber"/>.

        Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
        A <term>valuation</term> on <m>R</m> is a function <m>v\colon R \to \Gamma \cup \{0\}</m>,
        where <m>\Gamma</m> is a totally ordered abelian group written multiplicatively, such that:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>v(0) = 0</m>, <m>v(1) = 1</m>. (We do not require <m>v^{-1}(0) = \{0\}</m>.)

        </ul>
        We declare two valuations to be equivalent if they give rise to the same sets <m>\{(x,y) \in R \times R \colon v(x) \leq v(y)\}</m>.
        Define the <term>valuative spectrum</term> <m>\Spv(R)</m> to be the set of equivalence classes of valuations of <m>R</m>,
        equipped with the topology generated by subsets of the form <m>\{v \in \Spv(R)\colon v(x) \leq v(y)\neq 0\}</m> for <m>x,y \in R</m>.

        Let <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> be a Huber ring. Let <m>\Spv(A^{\triangleright}, A^{\circ \circ})</m> be the subspace of <m>\Spv(A^{\triangleright})</m>
        consisting of those valuations <m>v</m> with the following property:
        either there is no convex proper subgroup of <m>\Gamma_v := v(v^{-1}(\Gamma))</m> containing <m>\{v(a)\colon a \in A^{\triangleright}, v(a) \geq 1\}</m>;
        or <m>v(x)</m> is cofinal in <m>\Gamma_v</m> for each <m>x \in A^{\circ \circ}</m>.
        Unpacking terminology here,
        a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>\Gamma</m> is <term>convex</term> if for all <m>x \leq y \in H</m>, we have <m>[x,y] \subseteq H</m>;

        (Note that we are not requiring that <m>v(x) \in H</m>.)
        When <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> is Tate, cofinality can be tested using a single topologically nilpotent unit <m>x</m>.

        This is again a spectral space (<xref ref="bib-Huber1"/>, Theorem 3.5(i));
        moreover, the inclusion <m>\Spa(A) \subseteq \Spv(A^{\triangleright}, A^{\circ \circ})</m> has a canonical retraction

          Consider a point <m>v \in \Spa A</m> contained in an open subspace <m>U</m> of <m>\Spa A</m>.
          Let <m>c\Gamma_v</m> be the convex subgroup of the value group <m>\Gamma_v</m> generated by all <m>v(a) \geq 1</m> for <m>a \in A^{\triangleright}</m>;

          Now choose a rational subspace <m>U(\tfrac{f_1,\dots,f_n}{g}) \subseteq U</m> containing <m>w</m>.
          Since <m>w(g) \neq 0</m>, there exists <m>a \in A</m> with <m>w(ag) \geq 1</m>. Then

        Unlike in the proof of <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings"/>, we will also need standard binary coverings with <m>g = 1</m>;
        these are sometimes called <term>standard Laurent coverings</term>.

        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a Huber pair, every covering of <m>\Spa A</m> is refined by a covering of the following form: fix <m>f_1,\dots,f_n \in A^{\triangleright}</m>
          generating the unit ideal and take <m>U_i = U(\tfrac{f_1,\dots,f_n}{f_i})</m> for <m>i=1,\dots,n</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-top-Huber-use-1"/>,
          we may start with a covering of <m>\Spa A</m> by rational subspaces of the form <m>U_i = U(\tfrac{1,f_{i1},\dots,f_{in_i}}{g_i})</m> for <m>i=1,\dots,m</m>.

        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be the set of products <m>t_1 \cdots t_m</m> with <m>t_i \in \{1,f_{i1},\dots,f_{in_i},g_i\}</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>t_i = g_i</m> for at least one <m>i</m>.
          Since <m>g_1,\dots,g_m \in S</m>, <m>S</m> generates the unit ideal, so the sets <m>U(\tfrac{S}{s})</m> for <m>s \in S</m> do form a covering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, note that for each <m>s = t_1 \cdots t_m \in S</m>, if we choose an index <m>i</m> for which <m>t_i = g_i</m>, then 
          we also obtain elements of <m>S</m> by replacing <m>g_i</m> with each of <m>1,f_{i1},\dots,f_{in_i}</m> in the product.
          This implies that <m>U(\tfrac{S}{s}) \subseteq U_i</m>, so we have found a refinement of our initial covering.

        <p>
          The Grothendieck topology on the opposite category of Huber pairs is generated by standard binary coverings.
          In fact only the types listed in <xref ref="exa-types-of-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/> are needed.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a Huber pair.
          To prove that every covering of <m>\Spa A</m> is refined by a covering generated by standard binary coverings,
          thanks to <xref ref="lem-standard-rational-covering"/>, we are free to start with a covering of <m>\Spa A</m>
          by the sets <m>U_i = U(\tfrac{f_1,\dots,f_n}{f_i})</m> for <m>i=1,\dots,n</m> for some elements <m>f_1,\dots,f_n \in A^{\triangleright}</m> generating the unit ideal.
          We can then proceed by induction on <m>n</m>, with induction step as in the proof of <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings"/>.
          As for the base cases,  note that <m>n=1</m> is trivial.
          For <m>n=2</m>, choose <m>a_1, a_2 \in A^{\triangleright}</m> with <m>a_1 f_1 + a_2 f_2 = 1</m>,
          then pass to the terms of the standard binary covering defined by <m>a_1 f_1</m>; on each term, at least one of <m>f_1</m> or <m>f_2</m> is a unit
          and so we are considering a standard Laurent covering.

      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="prop-standard-binary-coverings-Huber"/> suggests that to topologize the category of analytic rings,
        it will already give useful results to just take the coverings generated by standard binary coverings.
        We will pursue this point in <xref ref="sec_huber_local"/>.
