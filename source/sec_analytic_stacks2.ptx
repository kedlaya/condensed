    <title>Definition of analytic stacks</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        An <term>analytic stack</term> is an accessible (<xref ref="rem-accessible"/>)
        functor <m>F\colon \AnRing \to \Set</m> with the following property:
        for any hypercovering <m>\AnSpec(A_\bullet) \to \AnSpec(A)</m> by <m>!</m>-able maps
        for which <m>\calD(\Mod_A) \cong \lim^! \calD(\Mod_{A_\bullet})</m>,
        we have
        <me>
          F(A) \cong \lim X(A_\bullet)
        </me>.
        Let <m>\AnStack</m> be the category of analytic stacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, any representable functor is an analytic stack
        (and by Yoneda this defines a full embedding <m>\AnRing^{\op} \to \AnStack</m>).
        With this, the accessibility condition ensures that
        any object is a small colimit of representable functors.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        This is not quite the definition of <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-youtube"/> because
        we are taking functors valued in sets, not something more simplicial.
        This difference is certainly relevant but will not appear in the examples we consider.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example>
      <p>
        Adic spaces, solid adic spaces, and dagger spaces all give rise to analytic stacks;
        in particular, the last of these include complex analytic spaces and Berkovich spaces.
        However, it is not clear that these functors are fully faithful.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        There is a functor <m>\Sch \to \AnStack</m> taking <m>\Spec A</m> to <m>\AnSpec \underline{A}</m>
        where the discrete condensed ring <m>\underline{A}</m> is interpreted as a discrete analytic ring.
        This functor is fully faithful by a theorem of Bhatt.
      </p>
      <p>
        This construction extends further to algebraic stacks.
        For example, using Stone duality (<xref ref="exa-embed-cset-into-schemes"/>) we get a fully faithful functor
        <m>\CSet \to \AnStack</m>.
        This allows to give meaning to the assertion that the definition of a norm function on an analytic ring
        (<xref ref="def-norm-function"/>) corresponds to a morphism <m>\AnSpec A \to [0,\infty]</m> of analytic stacks;
        in this formulation, one can extend the definition immediately to arbitrary analytic stacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, if we start with an analytic ring <m>A</m>, we can consider schemes over <m>\Spec A^{\triangleright}</m>
        and form the functor taking <m>\Spec B</m> to <m>\AnSpec \underline{B}</m> where <m>\underline{B}</m>
        is given the analytic ring structure induced from <m>A</m>. This again defines a functor to analytic stacks.

    <title>Flavors of the Riemann sphere</title>
    <p>
      To illustrate the richness of the category of analytic stacks, we indicate how some different flavors of the
      Riemann sphere interact within this category.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        We can form a sequence of morphisms of analytic stacks
        <me>
          X_1 \to X_2 \to X_3 \to X_4 \to X_5 \to X_6 
        </me>
        in which:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>X_1</m> is the topological manifold <m>S^2</m>.
            This corresponds to taking the ring <m>\Cts(S^2, \CC)</m> over <m>\CC_{\liquid}</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>X_2</m> is the <m>C^\infty</m> manifold <m>S^2</m>.
            This again corresponds to take the ring of global sections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>X_3</m> is the real analytic manifold <m>S^2</m>. This cannot be treated globally;
            instead it is created by glueing as in <xref ref="sec_gaga"/>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>X_4</m> is the complex analytic manifold <m>S^2</m>. This is again created by glueing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>X_5</m> is the scheme <m>\PP^1_\CC</m>. This is again created by glueing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>X_6</m> is the topological space <m>S^2</m> treated as a condensed set.
            As a reminder, this is created by covering <m>S^2</m> with a profinite set.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <xref ref="thm-gaga-liquid"/> implies that <m>X_4 \to X_5</m> is an isomorphism of analytic stacks!
        The other maps are not isomorphisms.
      </p>
    </example>

    <title>A final remark</title>
    <remark xml:id="rem-morse">
      <p>
        One potential use of this setup is to construct the sort of <term>virtual fundamental classes</term>
        which are needed all over the place in enumerative geometry. These are needed to count intersections
        of two geometric objects in cases where the <q>expected dimension</q> of the intersection is 0
        but things can sometimes behave more badly. This is fairly familiar in algebraic geometry, where
        various techniques exist to handle this (moving lemmas, deformation to the normal cone) but is
        much more problematic in less rigid geometries, such as symplectic geometry (where such enumerative
        questions are fundamental in mirror symmetry).
      </p>
      <p>
        A model case of this can be seen by considering <m>R = \Cts(\RR, \RR)</m> as a condensed ring.
        It can be shown that for <m>f \in R</m>, the isomorphism class of the quotient <m>R/(f)</m>
        determines <m>f</m> up to a unit; in particular this can be used to detect whether <m>f</m> has a sign
        crossing at one of its zeroes, even when the Taylor series of <m>f</m> is identically zero.
