    <title>Huber rings</title>
    <p>
      We first recall the definition of what Huber calls an <term><m>f</m>-adic ring</term> in <xref ref="bib-Huber1"/> and subsequent work.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>(commutative) Huber ring</term> is a topological commutative ring <m>A</m> admitting an open subring <m>A_0</m> (a <term>ring of definition</term>)
        which in turn contains a finitely generated ideal <m>I</m> (an <term>ideal of definition</term>) such that the topology on <m>A_0</m> is the <m>I</m>-adic topology.
        This implies in particular that <m>A</m> is <term>linearly topologized</term> (meaning that it admits a neighborhood basis of 0 consisting of subgroups).
      </p>
      <p>
        An element <m>x \in A</m> is <term>topologically nilpotent</term> if <m>1,x,x^2,\dots</m> is a null sequence.
        We say that a Huber ring is <term>Tate</term> if it contains a topologically nilpotent unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        A subset <m>S</m> is <term>bounded</term> if for every neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>0</m> in <m>A</m>,
        there exists a neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>0</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>V \cdot S \subseteq U</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> a Huber ring, the topological completion <m>\hat{A}</m> of <m>A</m> is again a Huber ring; if <m>A_0</m> is a ring of definition of <m>A</m>
        and <m>I</m> is an ideal of definition of <m>A_0</m>, then then the <m>I</m>-adic completion <m>\hat{A}_0</m> of <m>A_0</m> is a ring of definition of <m>\hat{A}</m>
        and <m>I\hat{A}_0</m> is an ideal of definition of <m>\hat{A}_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will mostly be interested in complete Huber rings in what follows; note that these are solid as condensed abelian groups. 
        We will pick up this thread in <xref ref="subsec-solid-Huber"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example>
      <p>
        Any discrete ring is Huber but not Tate.
        The ring <m>\ZZ_p</m> for the <m>p</m>-adic topology is Huber but not Tate.
        The ring <m>\QQ_p</m> for the <m>p</m>-adic topology is Huber and also Tate.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-strongly-noetherian">
      <p>
        For any Huber ring <m>A</m>, with a ring of definition <m>A_0</m> and an ideal of definition <m>I</m>,
        we obtain a Huber pair <m>A\langle T_1,\dots,T_n\rangle</m> with a ring of definition <m>A_0 \langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m>,
        the <m>I</m>-adic completion of <m>A[T_1,\dots,T_n]</m>, and an ideal of definition <m>I A_0 \langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m>.
        This is called the <term>Tate algebra</term> in the variables <m>T_1,\dots,T_n</m> over <m>A</m>; 
        however, it is a Tate Huber ring if and only if <m>A</m> is.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no analogue of the Hilbert basis theorem in this context: if <m>A</m> is noetherian (even a field) it can happen that <m>A\langle T \rangle</m> is not noetherian
        (<xref ref="bib-Fujiwara-Gabber-Kato"/>, section 8.3). We say that <m>A</m> is <term>strongly noetherian</term> if <m>A \langle T_1,\dots,T_n \rangle</m> is noetherian
        for all <m>n \in \NN</m>; for instance this holds when <m>A</m> is a nonarchimedean field.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      The concept of a Huber ring is closely related to the concept of a <term>nonarchimedean Banach ring</term>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-submult-seminorm">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative ring, a <em>submultiplicative seminorm</em> on <m>R</m> is a function <m>|\bullet|\colon R \to \RR_{\geq 0}</m> satisfying the following conditions.
        <ol>
          <li>
            We have <m>|0| = 0</m>. If <m>R \neq 0</m>, then also <m>|1| = |-1| = 1</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            For all <m>x,y \in R</m>, <m>|x+y| \leq |x| + |y|</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            For all <m>x,y \in R</m>, <m>|xy| \leq |x| |y|</m>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Some variations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the first condition can be upgraded to say that <m>|x| = 0</m> if and only if <m>x  =0</m>, we may say that <m>|\bullet|</m> is a <term>norm</term> rather than a seminorm.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the second condition can be upgraded to say that <m>|x+y| \leq \max\{|x|, |y|\}</m>, we may say that <m>|\bullet|</m> is <term>nonarchimedean</term>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the third condition can be upgraded to say that <m>|x^n| = |x|^n</m> for all <m>x \in R</m> and all positive integers <m>n</m>, we may say that <m>|\bullet|</m> is 
            <term>power-multiplicative</term> rather than submultiplicative.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the third condition can be upgraded to say that <m>|xy| = |x||y|</m> for all <m>x,y \in R</m>, we may say that <m>|\bullet|</m> is <term>multiplicative</term>
            rather than submultiplicative.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> 
        Any submultiplicative seminorm defines a <term>norm topology</term> on <m>R</m> with respect to which the ring operations are continuous.
        A <term>(commutative) Banach ring</term> consists of a commutative ring <m>R</m> equipped with a submultiplicative norm such that <m>R</m> is complete for the norm topology.
        As for Huber rings, we say that a Banach ring is <term>Tate</term> if it contains a topologically nilpotent unit.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-Huber-vs-Banach">
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> a nonarchimedean Banach ring, the set of <m>A_0</m> consisting of <m>x \in A</m> with <m>|x| \leq 1</m> is an open subring of <m>A</m>.
        If <m>A</m> is also Tate, then for any topologically nilpotent unit <m>\varpi \in A</m>, for <m>n</m> sufficiently large, <m>\varpi^n \in A_0</m>
        and the topology on <m>A_0</m> is the <m>\varpi^n</m>-adic topology. Consequently, in this case the underlying topological ring of <m>A</m> is a complete Huber ring;
        moreover, a subset <m>S</m> is bounded in the sense of Huber rings if and only if <m>|S| \subseteq [0, \infty)</m> is bounded away from <m>\infty</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, for <m>A</m> a complete Huber ring which is Tate, we can promote <m>A</m> to a Banach ring as follows.
        Let <m>A_0</m> be a ring of definition, let <m>I = (y_1,\dots,y_m)</m> be an ideal of definition,
        and let <m>\varpi \in A</m> be a topologically nilpotent unit.
        By replacing <m>\varpi</m> with a power if needed, we can ensure that <m>\varpi \in I</m>;
        then <m>\varpi = a_1 y_1 + \cdots + a_m y_m</m> for some <m>a_1,\dots,a_m \in A_0</m>, 
        so in particular <m>I</m> generates the unit ideal of <m>A</m>. 
        Conversely, since multiplication by <m>\varpi</m> is a homeomorphism, <m>\varpi A_0</m> is open in <m>A</m> for every <m>n</m>
        so there exists some positive integer <m>m</m> such that <m>y_1^n, \dots,y_m^n \in \varpi A_0</m>.
        We deduce that <m>(\varpi)</m> is also an ideal of definition of <m>A_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the previous paragraph, we have a well-defined function <m>|\bullet|\colon A \to \RR</m> taking <m>x</m> to <m>0</m> if <m>x = 0</m>, 
        and otherwise to <m>2^{-n}</m> where <m>n</m> is the largest integer such that <m>x \in \varpi^n A_0</m>.
        It is easy to verify that this defines a submultiplicative norm on <m>A</m> giving the correct norm topology.

    <title>Rings of integral elements</title>
    <p>
      In Huber's theory, to define a good notion of the <term>adic spectrum</term> (to be introduced in <xref ref="subsec-adic-spectra"/>)
      one must work with not just a Huber ring, but a certain auxiliary ring attached to it.
      We will see later in this section that this extra structure admits a natural interpretation in the context of analytic rings
      (<xref ref="subsec-solid-Huber"/>).
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-Huber-power-bounded">
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a Huber ring.
        An element <m>x \in A</m> is <term>power-bounded</term> if the set <m>\{1,x,x^2,\dots\}</m> is bounded in <m>A</m>.
        The power-bounded elements form an open subring <m>A^{\circ}</m> of <m>A</m> containing any ring of definition.
        The topologically nilpotent elements form a radical ideal <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> of <m>A^{\circ}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, <m>A^\circ</m> need not be bounded. When it is, we say that <m>A</m> is a <term>uniform</term> Huber ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        The ring <m>A = \QQ_p[T]/(T^2)</m>, topologized as <m>\QQ_p \times \QQ_p</m>, is a complete Tate Huber ring:
        we may take <m>A_0 = \ZZ_p \oplus \ZZ_p T</m> as a ring of definition and <m>I = p A_0</m> as an ideal of definition.
        In this case, <m>A^{\circ} = \ZZ_p \oplus \QQ_p T</m> which is not bounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using similar logic, one may see that <m>A</m> is a Tate Huber ring which is not reduced, then it is not uniform either.
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> a Huber ring, a <term>ring of integral elements</term> of <m>A</m> is a subring <m>A^+</m> of <m>A^{\circ}</m>
        which is open and integrally closed in <m>A</m>. Like <m>A^\circ</m>, <m>A^+</m> need not be bounded.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Any ring of integral elements contains <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m>: if <m>x \in A</m> is topologically nilpotent, then
        the openness of <m>A^+</m> ensures that for some positive integer <m>n</m> we have <m>x^n \in A^+</m>,
        and the integral closure in <m>A</m> then forces <m>x \in A^+</m>.
        Since <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> is itself an open subset of <m>A</m>, we see from this that rings of integral elements of <m>A</m>
        are in bijection with integrally closed subrings of <m>A^\circ/A^{\circ \circ}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> is itself an open neighborhood of <m>0</m> in <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>.
        We may thus redefine a ring of integral elements of <m>A</m> to be simply an integrally closed subring of <m>A^{\circ}</m> containing <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m>.
        For example, <m>A^\circ</m> is such a subring; this includes the assertion that it is integrally closed, which we will recover later
        by proving an analogue for solid rings (<xref ref="lem-analytic-circ-circ-circ"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>Huber pair</term> is a pair <m>A = (A^{\triangleright}, A^+)</m> in which <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> is a Huber ring
        and <m>A^+</m> is a ring of integral elements of <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>. We will apply adjectives like <term>complete</term> and <term>Tate</term>
        to a Huber pair by passing through to the underlying Huber ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        We can construct multiple complete Huber pairs <m>A</m> with <m>A^{\triangleright} = \QQ_p \langle T \rangle</m>:
        in one case we take <m>A^+ = \ZZ_p \langle T \rangle</m>, and in the other we take the smaller ring <m>A^+ = \ZZ_p + p \ZZ_p \langle T \rangle</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In Huber's theory, the difference between a Huber ring and a Huber pair manifests in the definition of the <term>adic spectrum</term>;
        see <xref ref="subsec-adic-spectra"/>.
        the elements of the adic spectrum are (equivalence classes of) continuous (semi)valuations on the underlying Huber ring
        whose valuation rings contains the ring of integral elements. 
        This has some effect when glueing adic spectra together to make <term>adic spaces</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this difference can also be detected from the point of view of solid modules,
        which means that different Huber pairs with the same underlying Huber ring will give rise to distinct solid analytic rings.
        This is one indication that analytic rings will provide a satisfactory basis for constructing analytic stacks in a manner that can absorb adic spaces.

      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> a complete Huber ring, there is a functor from solid analytic rings <m>A</m> with underlying ring <m>\underline{A^{\triangleright}}</m>
          to complete Huber pairs with underlying ring <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> mapping <m>A</m> to <m>(A^{\triangleright}, A^+)</m> for <m>A^+</m> defined as in 
          <xref ref="def-solid-integral-elements"/>. Moreover, this functor has a left adjoint denoted <m>(A^{\triangleright}, A^+) \mapsto (A^{\triangleright}, A^+)_\solid</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The fact that the functor does yield a ring of integral elements is the content of <xref ref="prop-solid-integral-elements"/>.
          The left adjoint takes a Huber pair <m>(A^{\triangleright}, A^+)</m> to <m>(\underline{A^{\triangleright}}, \Mod_{\underline{A^{\triangleright}} \liquid A^+})</m>;
          the inclusion <m>A^+ \subseteq A^\circ</m> ensures that <m>A^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_{\underline{A^{\triangleright}} \liquid A^+}</m>.

          Consequently, the functor <m>A \mapsto (A^{\triangleright}, A^+)_\solid</m> is fully faithful.

    <remark xml:id="rem-Huber-pair-from-solid">
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is a solid analytic ring, then we cannot necessarily equip <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> with the structure of a Huber ring
        in such a way that <m>A^\circ</m> and <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> are the sets of power-bounded and topologically nilpotent elements, respectively.
        (One issue is finding a finitely generated ideal of definition.)
        However, we can still treat <m>A(*) := (A^{\triangleright}(*), A^+)</m> as a complete Huber pair for the <em>discrete</em> topology on <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>;
        this will be useful for transferring information about Huber pairs to solid analytic rings.
