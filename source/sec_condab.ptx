  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now consider the condensed analogues of abelian groups.
      This will implicitly tell us things about condensed <m>R</m>-modules for any (discrete) commutative ring <m>R</m>,
      as these will be defined as <m>R</m>-module objects in condensed abelian groups.

    <title>Condensed abelian groups</title>
    <p>
      Since we are now talking about sheaves on a Grothendieck topology, we must distinguish between sheaves and presheaves.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The forgetful functor from <m>\CSet</m> to <m>\Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Set)</m> (i.e., presheaves in sets on <m>\Prof</m>)
        has a left adjoint called <term>sheafification</term>. Concretely, given <m>F \in \Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Set)</m>, its
        sheafification evaluates on <m>S</m> to the colimit of <m>\prod_i F(T_i)</m> over all finite jointly surjective families of morphisms <m>T_i \to S</m> in <m>\Prof</m>.
        (Note that this makes sense because <m>\Prof</m> is a small category.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        We define the category <m>\CAb</m> of <term>condensed abelian groups</term> as the category of abelian group objects in <m>\CSet</m>.
        That is, an object of <m>\CAb</m> is a functor in <m>\Fun(\Prof^{\op}, \Ab)</m> which when composed to <m>\Ab \to \Set</m> yields an object of <m>\CSet</m>
        (meaning that it satisfies the same compatibilities with finite disjoint unions and arbitrary surjections).
      </p>
      <p>
        The category <m>\CAb</m> is abelian, but the cokernels are obtained by taking the presheaf cokernel (i.e., point by point)
        and then sheafifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The category <m>\CAb</m> contains the sequentially topologized abelian groups <m>\TopAb^{\seq}</m> as a full subcategory.
        In particular it contains the discrete abelian groups <m>\Ab</m> as a full subcategory.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Beware that the functor <m>\CSet \to \Top</m> (<xref ref="def-functor-cset-top"/>) does <em>not</em> promote to a functor <m>\CAb \to \TopAb</m>!
        The problem (as noted in <xref ref="rem-cset-to-top-does-not-commute-with-products"/>) is that this functor does not preserve products,
        so for instance the multiplication map <m>X \times X \to X</m> of an object of <m>\CSet</m> does not transfer to a corresponding map of topological spaces.
        This is one reason why the theory we are about to described cannot be mirrored in topological abelian groups;
        another is the existence of examples of bad topological quotients which nonetheless work well in condensed abelian groups, such as <xref ref="exa-quotient-by-discrete"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-quotient-by-discrete">
      <p>
        There is a natural homomorphism <m>\RR_{\disc} \to \RR</m> of topological abelian groups.
        Applying the functor <m>\Top \to \CSet</m>, we obtain a homomorphism in <m>\CAb</m>, which therefore has a cokernel <m>\underline{\RR}/\underline{\RR}_{\disc}</m>.
        Explicitly, for <m>S \in \Prof</m>, <m>\underline{\RR}(S)</m> consists of continuous maps <m>S \to \RR</m> while <m>\underline{\RR}_{\disc}(S)</m> consists of locally constant functions <m>S \to \RR</m>.
        In this case, we showed in <xref ref="exa-quotient-of-r-by-discrete"/> that there is no sheafification required: <m>(\underline{\RR}/\underline{\RR}_{\disc})(S) = \underline{\RR}(S)/\underline{\RR}_{\disc}(S)</m>.
        See <xref ref="rem-no-sheafification-when-left-solid"/> for another explanation of this observation.
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition xml:id="def-free-condensed-ab">
      <p>
        There is an obvious forgetful functor <m>\CAb \to \CSet</m>.
        This has a left adjoint <m>X \mapsto \ZZ[X]</m>
        where <m>\ZZ[X]</m> denotes the sheafification of the presheaf <m>S \mapsto \ZZ[X(S)]</m>
        (and <m>\ZZ[X(S)]</m> denotes the free <m>\ZZ</m>-module on the set <m>X(S)</m>).
        The sheafification is already needed for trivial reasons: the empty set needs to go to 0 rather than to <m>\ZZ[X(\emptyset)] \cong \ZZ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an aside, it would be a bit more consistent to denote <m>\ZZ[X]</m> by <m>\underline{\ZZ}[X]</m>, but we will not bother doing this.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>S \in \Set</m> corresponding to <m>\underline{S} \in \CSet</m>, 
        <m>\ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> represents the discrete abelian group <m>\ZZ[S]</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-module-ring-topological-space">
      <p>
        For <m>X \in \Prof</m>, we claim that
        <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]</m> represents a locally compact topological group <m>G</m> which can be described as follows.
        For each <m>n \in \NN</m>, let <m>G_n</m> be the quotient of <m>X^{n}</m> by the action of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m>.
        We then get a monoid structure on <m>G_+ := \sqcup_{n \in \NN} G_n</m> induced by the maps <m>X^{m} \times X^n \cong X^{m+n}</m>.
        Finally, let <m>G</m> be the group completion of <m>G_+</m>, i.e., the quotient of <m>G_+ \times G_+</m> by the relation that <m>(a,b) \sim (c,d)</m>
        iff <m>a+d = b+c</m>; this is the colimit of the compact subspaces <m>G_n - G_n = \{x-y\colon x,y \in G_n\}</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that this description is correct, 
        note first that the presheaf <m>S \mapsto \ZZ[X(S)]</m> maps injectively to <m>\underline{G}</m> by mapping each element of <m>X(S)</m>
        to the corresponding map from <m>S</m> to <m>G_1 \cong X</m>. This induces an injective map <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}] \to \underline{G}</m>.
        To check that this map is surjective, note that any continuous map <m>S \to G</m> factors through <m>G_n - G_n</m> for some <m>n</m>.
        We can view <m>G_n</m> as a quotient of <m>X^{2n}</m>; then for some covering <m>S' \to S</m> the composition
        <m>S' \to S \to G_n</m> factors through <m>X^{2n}</m> (e.g., take <m>S' = S \times_{G_n-G_n} X^{2n}</m>).
        We can then lift the element of <m>\underline{G}(S)</m> corresponding to the chosen map to an element of <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}](S')</m>, proving the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <xref ref="rem-construct-profinite-cover"/>, one can upgrade the previous discussion to cover <m>X \in \CHaus</m>.
        By taking colimits, we can make a similar description for <m>X</m> a locally compact topological space
        (where now the colimit in the definition of <m>G</m> runs over both <m>n</m> and compact subspaces of <m>X</m>).
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-module-ring-topological-space"/>,
        the map <m>X_{\disc} \to X</m> induces an injection <m>\ZZ[X] = \ZZ[\underline{X_{\disc}}] \to \ZZ[\underline{X}]</m>
        which is a bijection of underlying groups but not a homeomorphism.
        The maps <m>X \to X_i</m> induce a natural map <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}] \to \varprojlim_i \ZZ[X_i]</m> at the level of topological abelian
        groups, but this map is not a bijection even on underlying groups! 
        One way to see this is to interpret <m>\ZZ[X]</m> as the set of <m>\ZZ</m>-linear combinations of Dirac measures on <m>X</m>,
        and <m>\varprojlim_i \ZZ[X_i]</m> as the full set of <m>\ZZ</m>-valued measures on <m>X</m>;
        the latter will end up being the solidification of <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]</m> (<xref ref="lem-identify-solidification-of-free"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-projective-in-cab">
      <p>
        Any <m>X \in \Set</m> is projective as an object of <m>\CSet</m>;
        by adjunction, <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]</m> is projective in <m>\CAb</m>.
        In particular, for any singleton <m>* \in \Prof</m>, the functor <m>\CAb \to \Ab</m>
        given by evaluation at <m>*</m> is exact.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, for <m>X \in \Prof</m>, the objects <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]</m> in <m>\CAb</m> form a collection of compact generators,
        but they are in general not projective.
        Namely, projectivity would say that for <m>Z \to Y</m> an epimorphism in <m>\CAb</m>, the map
        <m>Z(X) \to Z(Y)</m> is again surjective; this is not guaranteed 
        because objects of <m>\CAb</m> are sheaves rather than presheaves (<xref ref="rem-surjection-of-sheaves"/>; 
        compare also <xref ref="rem-cover-two-copies-of-NN"/>).
        In fact, projective objects in <m>\CAb</m> are somehat hard to come by; see <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/> for a key exception.

    <title>Internal Hom and tensor product</title>
    <definition xml:id="def-condensed-ab-tensor-product">
      <p>
        We obtain a symmetric monoidal tensor product <m>\otimes</m> with unit <m>\ZZ[*]</m> by sheafifying the pointwise tensor product.
        For <m>X,Y \in \CSet</m>, we have a natural identification

          \ZZ[X] \otimes \ZZ[Y] \cong \ZZ[X \times Y]

        Using the tensor product, we may define the internal Hom functor <m>\iHom_{\CAb}</m> so as to satisfy Hom-tensor adjunction:
        <md>
          \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \iHom_{\CAb}(M, N)) \cong \Hom_{\CAb}(P \otimes M, N)

    <remark>
      <p>
        Although it may look innocuous, <xref ref="def-condensed-ab-tensor-product"/> is a crucial point in the theory!
        Despite the fact that the basic objects <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]</m> for <m>X \in \Prof</m> are all represented by topological (even locally compact)
        abelian groups, and <m>\otimes</m> acts on these objects via <xref ref="eq-tensor-product-of-profinite"/>, 
        the flexibility to sheafify over coverings of and by profinite sets will prove to be indispensable.

        The same logic applies when <m>S \in \Top^{\seq}</m> is locally compact: by <xref ref="prop-cset-to-top-left-adjoint"/> and <xref ref="prop-sequential"/>,
        we still have <m>\Hom_{\CSet}(\underline{S \times T}, \underline{X}) = \Cts(S \times T, X)</m>,

        By the general argument of Grothendieck, <m>\CAb</m> contains enough injective objects.
        Since the functor <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(M, \bullet)</m> is left exact, 
        we may define right derived functors <m>\Ext^i_{\CAb}(M, \bullet)</m> and even the full derived functor
        on the bounded-below derived category.
        In light of <xref ref="eq-expression-of-internal-hom-sections"/>, we define the internal Ext object <m>\iExt^i_{\CAb}(M, N)</m> by sheafifying the presheaf

    <title>The sequence space</title>
    <p>
      The definition of a condensed abelian group makes it quite hard to work with any examples.
      We next introduce an object that will be key to a further elucidation of the category.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-internally-projective-object">
      <p>
        Define the <term>sequence space</term> as the object <m>P := \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> in <m>\CAb</m>.
        We may promote <m>P</m> to a ring object in <m>\CAb</m> using the fact that the addition map <m>\NN \times \NN \to \NN</m> extends to a continuous map <m>\NN_\infty \times \NN_\infty \to \NN_\infty</m>
        by the rule that <m>\bullet + \infty = \infty + \bullet = \infty</m>.
        The composition <m>\ZZ[\NN] \to \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]</m> then becomes a ring structure when we identify <m>\ZZ[\NN]</m> with <m>\ZZ[x]</m> via <m>[n] \mapsto x^n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the inclusion <m>\ZZ[\underline{\infty}] \to \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]</m> is split by the map corresponding to the unique projection
        <m>\NN_\infty \to \infty</m>, we have an isomorphism <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \cong \ZZ[\underline{\infty}] \oplus P</m> in <m>\CAb</m>.
        For a generalization of this splitting construction, see <xref ref="lem-splitting-closed-sub"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see from this that <m>P \in \CAb</m> is represented by a topological abelian group with underlying group <m>\ZZ[\NN]</m> equipped with 
        the subspace topology from <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]</m>
        (<xref ref="exa-module-ring-topological-space"/>).
        For example, the sequence <m>[0], [1], \dots</m> is a null sequence for this topology.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-coord-map">
     <p>
        Recall from <xref ref="rem-interpret-sequential-limits"/> that for <m>X</m> a Hausdorff topological group, 
        <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}], \underline{X})</m> can be interpreted as the space of convergent sequences in <m>X</m>.
        By the same token, <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{X})</m> can be interpreted as the space of <term>null sequences</term> in <m>X</m>;
        for <m>n \in \NN</m>, precomposing with the map <m>\underline{\ZZ} \to P</m> corresponding to <m>\{n\} \to \NN_\infty</m>
        gives the <m>n</m>-th coordinate map <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{X}) \to \Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{\ZZ}, \underline{X}) = X</m> on null sequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular this applies when <m>X \in \Prof</m>, but note that this is the <q>wrong way around</q>:
        an object of <m>\CSet</m> is characterized by its maps <em>out of</em> profinite sets, not into them.
        Nonetheless it may be helpful to keep this interpretation of <m>P</m> in mind going forward,
        in order to be able to parse the following arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We highlight one concrete example.
        For <m>n \in \NN</m>, the sequence valued in <m>\ZZ</m> with a 1 in position <m>n</m> and 0 elsewhere is a null sequence for the discrete topology;
        it thus corresponds to a map <m>c_n\colon P \to \underline{\ZZ}</m> taking <m>[n]</m> to 1 and <m>[m]</m> to 0 for <m>m \neq n</m>.
        Another way to obtain this map is to apply adjunction to the morphism <m>\NN_\infty \to \{n\}</m> in <m>\Prof</m>
        and then factor the resulting map <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \to \ZZ[\underline{\{n\}}] \cong \ZZ</m> through <m>P</m>.
        Putting the maps <m>c_n</m> together yields the <term>coordinate map</term> <m>c\colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>
        which has dense image; this statement will later be upgraded to say this map induces an isomorphism of solidifications (<xref ref="cor-replace-prod-with-bounded-solid"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-null-null-sequences">
      <p>
        As a counterpart to <xref ref="rem-coord-map"/>, we note that if <m>X \in \CAb</m> is <em>not</em> represented by a topological space,
        then an element of <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{X})</m> need not be uniquely determined by its images under the coordinate maps.
        That is because we can reanalyze the product of the coordinate maps as a pullback along the morphism <m>\ZZ[\NN_{\disc}] \to \ZZ[\NN_{\infty}]/\ZZ[\infty]</m>
        of topological groups, which is surjective on underlying groups but does not correspond to a surjection in <m>\CAb</m>.
        The kernel of the joint coordinate maps constitutes of objects which we might call <term>null null sequences</term>
        as they cannot be studied using the coordinate maps; we will handle them by rewriting a few standard series manipulations from analysis
        into a more algebraic framework (<xref ref="rem-infinite-series"/>).

          <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]/\ZZ[\underline{Z}] \cong \ZZ[\underline{X'}]/\ZZ[\underline{Z'}]</m> compatible with the isomorphism of discrete groups <m>\ZZ[U] \cong \ZZ[U']</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          We may formally reduce to the case where <m>Z = \{\infty\}</m> is a singleton (by comparing other two cases to this one).
          Then the homeomorphism <m>U' \cong U</m> extends to a surjection <m>X' \to X</m> in <m>\Prof</m>;
          we thus have a surjection <m>\ZZ[\underline{X'}]/\ZZ[\underline{Z'}] \to \ZZ[\underline{X}]/\ZZ[\underline{Z}]</m>
          which it will suffice to split.

          Apply <xref ref="lem-splitting-closed-sub"/> to construct a morphism <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}']/\ZZ[\underline{Z}'] \to \ZZ[\underline{X'}]</m> in <m>\CAb</m>
          splitting the canonical projection. 
          Since the composition <m>X' \to \ZZ[\underline{X}']/\ZZ[\underline{Z}'] \to \ZZ[\underline{X'}]</m> maps all of <m>Z'</m> to a single element, it factors through <m>X</m>.
          This gives us a map <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}] \to \ZZ[\underline{X}']/\ZZ[\underline{Z}']</m> inducing the desired splitting.

          With notation as in <xref ref="lem-splitting-closed-sub"/>, the assignment <m>U \mapsto \ZZ[\underline{X}]/\ZZ[\underline{Z}]</m>

          It suffices to observe that with notation as in <xref ref="prop-relative-free-module"/>,
          if we are given a morphism <m>U' \to U</m> in <m>\Top</m>, we can extend it to a morphism <m>X'' \to X</m>
          where <m>X''</m> is the closure of the image of the map <m>U' \to X' \times X</m>.
          Replacing <m>X'</m> with <m>X''</m> has no effect per <xref ref="prop-relative-free-module"/>.

        One application of <xref ref="prop-relative-free-module"/> is to show that <m>P</m> is projective in <m>\CAb</m>, as follows. 
        For any epimorphism <m>N' \to N</m> in <m>\CAb</m> and any map <m>P \to N</m>,
        we can lift the underlying map <m>\NN_\infty \to N</m> to a map <m>S \to N'</m> for some surjection <m>S \to N_\infty</m> in <m>\Prof</m>.
        Let <m>S_\infty</m> be the fiber of <m>S</m> above <m>\infty</m>;

        By picking one element of <m>S</m> above each <m>n \in \NN</m> but retaining the entire fiber <m>S_\infty</m> above <m>\infty</m>, 
        we may find another compactification <m>S'</m> of <m>\NN_\infty</m> admitting a map <m>S' \to S</m> such that <m>S' \to S \to \NN_\infty</m>

        Note that the projectivity of <m>P</m> is really a phenomenon of condensed abelian groups;
        it does <em>not</em> come from a corresponding statement at the level of condensed sets

          The object <m>P \in \CAb</m> is internally projective.

      <proof>
        <p>
          It will suffice to check a sheafified version of the usual arrow-theoretic definition of projectivity:
          for any <m>T \in \Prof</m>,
          given an epimorphism <m>N' \to N</m> in <m>\CAb</m> and a morphism <m>P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}] \to N</m>,
          we can pull back the latter along some surjection <m>T' \to T</m> in <m>\Prof</m> in such a way that the resulting morphism <m>P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}'] \to N</m>
          can be factored through <m>N'</m>.
          (Note that we do have to sheafify; we cannot hope to prove that <m>P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}]</m> is itself projective in <m>\CAb</m>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We proceed by adapting <xref ref="rem-internally-projective-cset"/> to this setting.
          We again have a surjection <m>S \to \NN_\infty \times T</m> in <m>\Prof</m> such that the element of
          <m>N(\NN_\infty \times T) = \Hom_{\CSet}(\underline{\NN_\infty \times T}, N)</m> corresponding to 
          <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty \times T}] \to P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}] \to N</m> via adjunction lifts to <m>N'(S)</m>.
          For <m>n \in \NN_\infty</m>, let <m>S_n</m> denote the fiber of <m>S \to \NN_\infty</m> over <m>n</m>;
          we again obtain a diagram of the form
          <figure>
            <image width="50%">
              <latex-image>
                \xymatrix{
                 \ZZ[\underline{S}]/\ZZ[\underline{S}_\infty] \ar[r] \ar[d]  &amp; N' \ar[d] \\
                 P \ar[r] &amp; N

        </p>
        <p>
          We next choose a covering <m>T' \to T</m> with the property that for each <m>n \in \NN</m>,
          the induced covering <m>S_n \times_{T} T' \to T'</m> splits.
          For instance, we could take <m>T' = T \times \prod_{n \in \NN} S_n</m> using the first projection to <m>T</m>;
          we get a splitting <m>T' \to S_n \times_T T'</m> by taking the projection <m>T' \to S_n</m> in the first factor and the identity in the second factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let <m>S'</m> be the closed subset of <m>S</m> consisting of <m>S_\infty</m> together with the image of one splitting of <m>S_n \to T'</m> for each <m>n \in \NN</m>;
          then <m>S' \to S \to \NN_\infty \times T'</m> is a surjection which restricts to a homeomorphism over <m>\NN \times T'</m>.
          We may thus pull back the previous diagram along
           <xref ref="prop-relative-free-module"/> to identify 
          <md>
            \ZZ[\underline{S'}]/\ZZ[\underline{S_\infty}] \cong \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty \times T'}]/\ZZ[\underline{\{\infty\} \times T'}] \cong P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T'}]
          </md>,
          and then obtain the map <m>P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T'}] \to N'</m> that we were looking for by writing
          <md>
            P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}'] \cong \ZZ[\underline{S'}]/\ZZ[\underline{S_\infty}] \to \ZZ[\underline{S}]/\ZZ[\underline{S_\infty}] \to N'
          </md>.

      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In principle, the proof of <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/> also shows that if <m>X \in \Prof</m>, <m>Z \subseteq X</m> is closed, and the subspace topology on <m>U := X \setminus Z</m> is discrete,
        then <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}]/\ZZ[\underline{Z}]</m> is internally projective in <m>\CAb</m>. However, in this case 
        <m>X \setminus Z</m> is either finite or countable, so this just reduces to saying that <m>\ZZ</m> and <m>P</m> are internally projective.
