  <title>Trailer: Abelian extensions of the rationals</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Though class field theory has its origins in the law of quadratic reciprocity discovered by Gauss,
      its proper beginning is indicated by the Kronecker-Weber theorem,
      first stated by Kronecker in 1853 and proved by Weber in 1886.
      Although one could skip this theorem and deduce it as a consequence of more general results later on, I prefer to work through it explicitly.
      It will serve as a trailer for the rest of the course, giving us a preview of a number of key elements:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            reciprocity laws;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            passage between local and global fields, using Galois theory;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            group cohomology, and applications to classifying field extensions;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            computations in local fields.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
