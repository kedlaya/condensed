  <title>Solid abelian groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We study in more the category of solid abelian groups, i.e., the category of solid <m>R</m>-modules for <m>R = \ZZ</m>.
      As a reminder of <xref ref="rem-solid-R-modules-as-solid-Z-modules"/>, we recall that this is the only case of the construction we will
      use in condensed mathematics; for <m>R \neq \ZZ</m> we will rather work with <m>R</m>-module objects in the category of solid abelian groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify notation (and to remind ourselves of the previous point), 
      let us define <m>\Ab_\solid</m> as a synonym for <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m>, the category of solid abelian groups.
      Let us also write <m>M_\solid</m> as shorthand for <m>M \otimes_{\ZZ} \ZZ_\solid</m>,
      meaning the image of a discrete abelian group <m>M</m> in <m>\Ab_\solid</m> (<xref ref="def-solidification"/>).

    <title>Solid abelian groups as topological groups</title>
    <p>
      We insert a remark to help justify why we set up the theory of solid abelian groups as we did.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-compare-solid-to-top-ab-group">
      <p>
        The category <m>\Ab_\solid</m> was custom-built to enforce the relation <xref ref="eq-formula-for-solid-module"/>.
        However, there is another context in which such a relation occurs more naturally: in the category <m>\TopAb</m> of topological abelian groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us spell this out in some detail. Start with <m>\ZZ</m> viewed as a discrete topological abelian group.
        The product <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m> is topologized as follows: one gets a neighborhood basis of open subsets by choosing an arbitrary finite subset <m>I_0 \subseteq I</m>
        and taking the preimage of an open subset under the projection <m>\prod_I \ZZ \to \prod_{I_0} \ZZ</m>. Since a finite product of copies of <m>\ZZ</m> is again discrete,
        every singleton set in the finite product is open; hence the neighborhood basis consists of subsets consisting of tuples with a fixed value in some finite set of coordinates
        and arbitrary values elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider a continuous map <m>\prod_I \ZZ \to \ZZ</m> of topological abelian groups. The inverse image of 0 must be open in <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m>, and contains the zero tuple,
        so for some finite subset <m>I_0 \subseteq I</m> it must contain the whole kernel of <m>\prod_I \ZZ \to \prod_{I_0} \ZZ</m>. But that makes the map a finite sum of coordinate
        projections; we conclude that
        <me>
          \Hom_{\TopAb}\left(\prod_I \ZZ, \ZZ\right) = \bigoplus_I \ZZ
        </me>
        and similarly
        <me>
          \Hom_{\TopAb}\left(\prod_I \ZZ, \prod_J \ZZ\right) = \prod_J \bigoplus_I \ZZ
        </me>.
        This formally implies (by taking colimits) that there is a functor <m>\Ab_\solid \to \TopAb</m> taking <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> to <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this functor is not <em>fully</em> faithful because of the deleterious effect of taking colimits on underlying topological spaces
        (e.g., see <xref ref="exa-solid-modules-with-underlying-zero"/>).
        This can be corrected by replacing the category of topological abelian groups with the category of condensed abelian groups, 
        in which cokernels behave more like in <m>\Ab_\solid</m>. This also will make the construction compatible with tensor products, which do not make sense in <m>\TopAb</m>.
        We will reconcile the points of view of solid abelian groups versus condensed abelian groups in <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-solid-modules-with-underlying-zero">
      <p>
        In <m>\Ab_\solid</m>, the object <m>\ZZ_\solid[T]</m> is the functor <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid \mapsto \left( \bigoplus_I \ZZ \right)[T] = \bigoplus_I \ZZ[T]</m>.
        We also have an object <m>\ZZ_\solid \langle T \rangle</m> which is the functor taking
        <me>
          \prod_I \ZZ_\solid \mapsto \left( \prod_I \ZZ[T] \right) \cap \left( \bigoplus_I \ZZ \right) \llbracket T \rrbracket \subset \left( \prod_I \ZZ \right) \llbracket T \rrbracket
        </me>;
        that is, we have an <m>I \times \NN</m> matrix over <m>\ZZ</m> in which each row and column has finite support.
        The cokernel of the obvious map <m>\ZZ_\solid[T] \to \ZZ_\solid \langle T \rangle</m> is an object of <m>\Ab_{\solid}</m>
        whose restriction to <m>\Ab</m> is zero (because <m>\bigoplus_I = \prod_I</m> when <m>I</m> is finite), but which is not the zero object.

    <title>Whitehead's problem for solid abelian groups</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The <term>Whitehead problem</term> asks whether every abelian group <m>A</m> with <m>\Ext^1_{\ZZ}(A, \ZZ) = 0</m> is free.
        It was shown by Shelah that this statement is in fact independent of the axioms of set theory (ZFC, or even ZFC plus the 
        continuum hypothesis).
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting side effect of the fact that the passage to solid modules gives us a meaningful duality between infinite
        products and coproducts is that the analogue of Whitehead's problem is easily resolved!

    <lemma xml:id="lem-submodule-free-over-PID">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any submodule of a free module (of arbitrary rank, possibly infinite or even uncountable) over a principal ideal domain is itself free (of the same or smaller rank).

      <title>Whitehead's problem for solid modules</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be an abelian group of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>
          such that <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(A_{\solid}, \ZZ_\solid) = 0</m>.
          Then <m>A</m> is a free module.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>\ZZ</m> is a principal ideal domain, using <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/> we may construct a free resolution of <m>A</m> of length 1:
          <men xml:id="eq-free-res-whitehead">
            0 \to \bigoplus_I \ZZ \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ \to A \to 0
          </men>.
          We may further ensure that <m>|I|, |J| \leq \kappa</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="prop-solidification-is-exact"/>, this remains exact under the passage from <m>\Ab</m> to <m>\Ab_\solid</m>:
          <men xml:id="eq-solid-free-res-whitehead">
            0 \to \bigoplus_I \ZZ_\solid \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ_\solid\to A_{\solid} \to 0
          </men>.
          Applying the dual functor <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(\bullet, \ZZ_\solid)</m> and using our hypothesis (and <xref ref="prop-solid-internal-hom"/>), we obtain the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(A_{\solid}, \ZZ_{\solid}) \to \prod_J \ZZ_{\solid} \to \prod_I \ZZ_{\solid} \to \iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(A_{\solid}, \ZZ_{\solid}) = 0
          </me>.
          This splits because <m>\prod_I \ZZ_{\solid}</m> is projective (here we diverge from the classical setting).
          Consequently, applying <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(\bullet, \ZZ_\solid)</m> recovers the sequence <xref ref="eq-solid-free-res-whitehead"/>,
          but with the additional information that this sequence is now split.
          Since the functor <m>A \mapsto A_\solid</m> is fully faithful (see <xref ref="def-solidification"/>),
          we deduce that <m>A</m> is a submodule of a free module, and hence free by <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/> again.

    <title>Finitely presented solid abelian groups</title>
    <p>
      To further illustrate that one can really work with the solid modules despite the somewhat abstract definition,
      we introduce and classify <term>finitely presented</term> solid abelian groups.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        An object <m>M \in \Ab_\solid</m> is <term>finitely generated</term> if it can be written as a quotient of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m>
        for some <m>I</m> with <m>|I| \leq \kappa</m>.
        The object <m>M</m> is <term>finitely presented</term> if it occurs as the cokernel of some morphism <m>\prod_J \ZZ_\solid \to \prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m>.

      <p>
        For any finitely generated abelian group <m>A</m>, <m>A_\solid</m> is finitely presented
        (see <xref ref="rem-infinite-coproduct-not-fingen"/> for a converse assertion).
        Also, any product <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> with <m>|I| \leq \kappa</m> is finitely presented;
        this accounts for all finitely generated <term>projective</term> objects as per <xref ref="lem-summand-of-product"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-summand-of-product">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any finitely generated projective object of <m>\Ab_\solid</m> has the form <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> for some <m>I</m>
          with <m>|I| \leq \kappa</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a finitely generated projective object of <m>\Ab_\solid</m>.
          By definition, there exists a surjective morphism <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid \to M</m>, which then can be split.
          The resulting splitting of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> corresponds to a splitting of its dual, which we identify with
          <m>\bigoplus_I \ZZ_\solid = \left( \bigoplus_I \ZZ \right)_\solid</m> using <xref ref="prop-solid-internal-hom"/>.
          By <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/>, any direct summand of <m>\bigoplus_I \ZZ</m> has the form <m>\bigoplus_J \ZZ</m>
          with <m>|J| \leq |I|\leq \kappa</m>; dualizing back yields the claim.

    <remark xml:id="rem-infinite-coproduct-not-fingen">
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is an abelian group which is not finitely generated, then <m>A_\solid</m> is not finitely generated.
        Namely, by <xref ref="eq-solid-hom-to-discrete"/>, the maps from <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> to <m>A_\solid</m>
        correspond to elements of <m>\bigoplus_I A</m>, so the image of any such map is (the image in <m>\Ab_\solid</m> of) a finitely
        generated subgroup of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, if <m>I</m> is an infinite index set, then <m>\bigoplus_I \ZZ_\solid = \left( \bigoplus_I \ZZ \right)_\solid</m> 
        is a projective object of <m>\Ab_\solid</m>
        which is not finitely generated.
        This implies in turn that the quotient <m>\left( \prod_I \ZZ_\solid \right) / \left( \bigoplus_I \ZZ_\solid \right)</m> is not finitely presented
        by a standard <q>two out of three</q> argument (compare <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 064R).

    <p>
      We may generate more interesting examples of finitely presented objects of <m>\Ab_\solid</m>

          the kernel of this map is again a free module of rank at most <m>\kappa</m>; that is, we have an exact sequence of abelian groups

        <p>
          When <m>Q = T</m> is finite, we may choose an exact sequence as in <xref ref="eq-length-1-resolution-of-solid"/> with <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> finite,

          In the general case, write <m>Q</m> as a sequential union of torsion subgroups <m>T_n</m>;
          we can then choose presentations

          we get an inverse system of these sequences in which the transition maps in the left and middle columns are surjective.

          for some set <m>K</m> with <m>|K| \leq \kappa</m> and some abelian group <m>Q</m>
          with <m>|Q| \leq \kappa</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The <q>if</q> assertion follows from <xref ref="exa-generate-finitely-presented"/>; we prove the <q>only if</q> assertion as follows.
          Let <m>M</m> be a finitely presented object of <m>\Ab_\solid</m>.
          By definition, we can find an exact sequence of the form
          <men xml:id="eq-cor-solid-torsion-by-free">
            0 \to \prod_J \ZZ_\solid \stackrel{g}{\to} \prod_I \ZZ_\solid \to M \to 0
          </men>.
          By taking duals (<xref ref="prop-solid-internal-hom"/>) and noting that everything in sight is discrete, 
          we get a map <m>h \colon \bigoplus_I \ZZ \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>h</m> is injective. We can then set <m>Q := \coker(h)</m> and carry out <xref ref="exa-generate-finitely-presented"/>;
          comparing <xref ref="eq-cor-solid-torsion-by-free"/> with the resulting exact sequence <xref ref="eq-hom-from-torsion-sequence"/>
          shows that <m>M \cong \iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce the general case to the previous case, apply <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/>
          to see that <m>\ima(h)</m> is also a free <m>\ZZ</m>-module. This means that the source
          <m>\bigoplus_I \ZZ</m> splits as <m>\ker(h)</m> plus a submodule isomorphic to <m>\ima(h)</m>, and both factors are free.
          This splitting transposes to a decomposition of the target <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> as a product of two factors,
          each itself a product of copies of <m>\ZZ_\solid</m> (as in <xref ref="lem-summand-of-product"/>). 
          Now note that the dual of <m>\ima(h)</m>, viewed as a subobject of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m>, is precisely
          the image of <m>g</m>; consequently, our splitting of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> projects to a splitting of <m>M</m>
          as the direct sum of the dual of <m>\ker(h)</m> with another module.
          We can now simultaneously discard the dual of <m>\ker(h)</m> as a summand of both <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> and <m>M</m>
          (leaving <m>\prod_J \ZZ_\solid</m> unchanged)
          leaving us in a situation where now the map <m>h</m> is injective.
          Applying the previous paragraph yields the desired result.

        In <xref ref="cor-solid-torsion-by-free"/>, the group <m>Q</m> cannot in general be taken to be torsion.
        This can be seen for instance from <xref ref="exa-extension-solid-Q"/>: taking <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m>,
        <m>Q = \QQ</m> yields the object <m>\widehat{\ZZ}_\solid/\ZZ_\solid</m>

        When <m>Q</m> is a torsion group that is not countable, we may still write it as a countable direct sum of Sylow subgroups:

          Q \cong \bigoplus_p Q[p^\infty]
        </me>
        where <m>p</m> runs over primes. We may correspondingly split <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m> as a direct sum of

      <p>
        Suppose now that <m>Q</m> is <m>p^\infty</m>-torsion for some prime <m>p</m>.
        We may write <m>Q</m> as the sequential colimit of <m>Q[p^n] = \ker(Q \stackrel{\times p^n}{\to} Q)</m>
        over <m>n \in \NN</m>, so we can still view <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m> as the limit of

    <title>The category of finitely presented solid abelian groups</title>

    <remark xml:id="rem-generate-finitely-presented">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-generate-finitely-presented"/>, the group <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m> may be further analyzed as follows.
        We have already seen in <xref ref="cor-length-1-resolution-of-solid"/> that if <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(Q, \ZZ) = 0</m>, then <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m>
        admits a projective resolution of length 1. If <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(Q, \ZZ) = \ZZ</m>, then we obtain an exact sequence of the form
        <me>
          0 \to Q_0 \to Q \to \ZZ \to 0
        </me>
        which we can split to obtain a summand <m>Q_0</m> of <m>Q</m> with <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(Q_0, \ZZ) = 0</m>;
        we then have  <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}((Q_0)_\solid, \ZZ_\solid) = \iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m>.
        By the same token, if <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(Q, \ZZ)</m> is finitely generated, we can similarly split <m>Q</m> as a direct sum <m>Q_0 \oplus \ZZ^n</m>
        with <m>\Hom_\ZZ(Q_0, \ZZ) = 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(Q, \ZZ)</m> is infinitely generated then no such splitting exists in general.
        For instance, if <m>Q = \prod_\NN \ZZ</m>, then the projection maps form a countable family of homomorphisms <m>Q \to \ZZ</m>
        with zero kernel, so we would have to take <m>Q_0 = 0</m>; but this is not possible because <m>Q</m> is not itself a free abelian group (see 
        <xref ref="rem-infinite-product-not-free"/>).
        Notably, this example is ruled out by taking <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m>, and indeed this process can be pushed through under this restriction.

        necessarily with <m>|I| = 2^{\aleph_0}</m>.
        The image of <m>\bigoplus_\NN \ZZ \to \prod_\NN \ZZ</m> would then be contained in <m>\bigoplus_J \ZZ</m>

        the divisible subgroup of <m>\left( \prod_\NN \ZZ \right) / \left( \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ \right)</m>
        is countable (as this quotient would be contained in the product of the torsion-free group <m>\bigoplus_{I \setminus J} \ZZ</m>

          closed under kernels, cokernels, and extensions.
          By <xref ref="cor-length-1-resolution-of-solid"/>, these are precisely the finitely presented objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the same token, since the objects <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m> with <m>|I| \leq \kappa</m> are compact generators of <m>\Ab_\solid</m>,
          we deduce that every object is a colimit of finitely presented objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <xref ref="cor-length-1-resolution-of-solid"/>, we also read off compatibility with tensor product 
          and with products over index sets of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>.
          Since we already have compatibility with kernels and cokernels, this implies compatibility with limits indexed by sets of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>
          and with finite colimits (since finite products and coproducts coincide in <m>\Ab_\solid</m>).

        We show by way of contradiction that the conclusions of <xref ref="prop-finitely-presented-generators-solid"/> cannot all hold when <m>\kappa \geq 2^{\aleph_0}</m>.
        Since we will have to make the restriction <m>\kappa = \aleph_0</m> later for other reasons, this is ultimately not so problematic for our purposes.

        Set <m>Q := \prod_\NN \ZZ</m> and choose a presentation as in <xref ref="eq-length-1-resolution-of-solid"/> with <m>|I|, |J| \leq 2^{\aleph_0}</m>.
        In <xref ref="eq-hom-from-torsion-sequence"/>, all of the terms except <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m> are finitely presented,
        so by the conclusions of <xref ref="prop-finitely-presented-generators-solid"/>, so must be <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m>.
        In particular, the image of <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m> in <m>\prod_J \ZZ_\solid</m> must be finitely generated,
        so we can apply the conclusion of <xref ref="lem-subobject-of-finitely-generated"/> to deduce that it can be written as <m>\prod_L \ZZ_\solid</m> for some <m>L</m> with <m>|L| \leq 2^{\aleph_0}</m>.

        Define <m>M \in \Ab_\solid</m> to make
        <me>
          0 \to \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid) \to \prod_J \ZZ_\solid \to M \to 0
        </me>
        an exact sequence. Since this sequence splits, it dualizes to an exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(M, \ZZ_\solid) \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ \to R \to 0
        </me>
        where 
        <me>
          R := \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid), \ZZ_\solid) \cong \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}\left(\prod_L \ZZ_\solid, \ZZ_\solid\right) \cong \bigoplus_L \ZZ
        </me> 
        is the solid double dual of <m>Q</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although <m>R</m> is not <em>a priori</em> equal to the algebraic double dual of <m>Q</m>,
        we may argue as in <xref ref="rem-generate-finitely-presented"/> that the projection maps <m>\prod_\NN \ZZ \to \ZZ</m>
        correspond to sections of <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q_\solid, \ZZ_\solid)</m>. Since the projection maps have zero joint kernel, the evaluation map <m>Q \to R</m>
        must be injective.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, since <m>g\colon \prod_J \ZZ_\solid \to \prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> factors through the projection <m>\prod_J \ZZ_\solid \to M</m>,
        <m>h \colon \bigoplus_I \ZZ \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ</m> factors through the inclusion <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(M, \ZZ_\solid) \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ</m>.
        From this, we see that the evaluation map <m>Q \to R</m> is also surjective.
        We conclude that <m>Q \cong R \cong \bigoplus_L \ZZ</m>,
        a contradiction against the fact that <m>Q</m> is known not to be a free abelian group (<xref ref="rem-infinite-product-not-free"/>).

        One can prove an analogue of <xref ref="prop-finitely-presented-generators-solid"/>
        for the category of <m>R</m>-module objects in <m>\Ab_\solid</m> where <m>R</m> is an algebra of finite type over <m>\ZZ</m>.
