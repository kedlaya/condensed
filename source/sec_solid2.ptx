      Since solid <m>R</m>-modules for any commutative ring <m>R</m> can be viewed as <m>R</m>-module objects in the category of solid abelian groups
      (<xref ref="rem-solid-R-modules-as-solid-Z-modules"/>),
      it makes sense to study the category of solid abelian groups in more detail, in part to demystify the construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify notation, let us define <m>\Ab_\solid</m> as a synonym for <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m>, the category of soild abelian groups.

    <title>Solid abelian groups as topological groups</title>
    <p>
      We insert a remark to help justify why we set up the theory of solid abelian groups as we did.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-compare-solid-to-top-ab-group">
      <p>
        The category <m>\Ab_\solid</m> was custom-built to enforce the relation <xref ref="eq-formula-for-solid-module"/>.
        However, there is another context in which such a relation occurs more naturally: in the category <m>\TopAb</m> of topological abelian groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us spell this out in some detail. Start with <m>\ZZ</m> viewed as a discrete topological abelian group.
        The product <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m> is topologized as follows: one gets a neighborhood basis of open subsets by choosing an arbitrary finite subset <m>I_0 \subseteq I</m>
        and taking the preimage of an open subset under the projection <m>\prod_I \ZZ \to \prod_{I_0} \ZZ</m>. Since a finite product of copies of <m>\ZZ</m> is again discrete,
        every singleton set in the finite product is open; hence the neighborhood basis consists of subsets consisting of tuples with a fixed value in some finite set of coordinates
        and arbitrary values elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider a continuous map <m>\prod_I \ZZ \to \ZZ</m> of topological abelian groups. The inverse image of 0 must be open in <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m>, and contains the zero tuple,
        so for some finite subset <m>I_0 \subseteq I</m> it must contain the whole kernel of <m>\prod_I \ZZ \to \prod_{I_0} \ZZ</m>. But that makes the map a finite sum of coordinate
        projections; we conclude that
        <me>
          \Hom_{\TopAb}\left(\prod_I \ZZ, \ZZ\right) = \bigoplus_I \ZZ
        </me>
        and similarly
        <me>
          \Hom_{\TopAb}\left(\prod_I \ZZ, \prod_J \ZZ\right) = \prod_J \bigoplus_I \ZZ.
        </me>
        This formally implies (by taking colimits) that there is a fully faithful functor <m>\Ab_\solid \to \TopAb</m> taking <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> to <m>\prod_I \ZZ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One question this raises is how to identify the essential image of this functor more concretely. We will answer this question by resolving the stronger question
        in the category of condensed abelian groups <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>.
        The reason to work there instead of in <m>\TopAb</m> is that the latter category does not have ideal structural properties from an algebraic point of view,
        for instance, it does not admit a tensor product satisfying the usual rules (symmetric monoidal plus Hom-tensor adjunction).
        By contrast, for solid <m>R</m>-modules one can set up a whole six functors formalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, we can and will embed the category <m>\TopAb</m> into the category <m>\CAb</m> of condensed abelian groups, which does admit reasonable operations like <m>\otimes</m>.
        In that context we will exhibit an embedding of <m>\Ab_\solid</m> into <m>\CAb</m> that does respect all operations (<xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>).

    <title>Whitehead's problem for solid abelian groups</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The <term>Whitehead problem</term> asks whether every abelian group <m>A</m> with <m>\Ext^1_{\ZZ}(A, \ZZ) = 0</m> is free.
        It was shown by Shelah that this statement is in fact independent of the axioms of set theory (ZFC, or even ZFC plus the 
        continuum hypothesis).
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting side effect of the fact that the passage to solid modules gives us a meaningful duality between infinite
        products and coproducts is that the analogue of Whitehead's problem is easily resolved! 
      </p>
    </remark>
    <proposition>
      <title>Whitehead's problem for solid modules</title>
      <statement>
        Let <m>A</m> be a <m>\ZZ</m>-module of cardinality <m>\leq \kappa</m>
        such that <m>\iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(A \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ_{\solid}, \ZZ_\solid)</m> = 0.
        Then <m>A</m> is a free module.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>\ZZ</m> is a principal ideal domain, we may construct a free resolution of <m>A</m> of length 1:
          <me>
            0 \to \bigoplus_I \ZZ \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ \to A \to 0.
          </me>
          We may further ensure that <m>|I|, |J| \leq \kappa</m>.
          By <xref ref="prop-solidification-is-exact"/>, this remains exact under solidification:
          <me>
            0 \to \bigoplus_I \ZZ_\solid \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ_\solid\to A  \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ_{\solid} \to 0.
          </me>
          Applying <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(\bullet, \ZZ_\solid)</m> and using our hypothesis, we obtain
          <me>
            0 \to \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(A \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ_{\solid}, \ZZ_{\solid}) \to \prod_J \ZZ_{\solid} \to \prod_I \ZZ_{\solid} \to \iExt^1_{\ZZ_\solid}(A \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ_{\solid}, \ZZ_{\solid}) = 0.
          </me>
          This splits because <m>\prod_I \ZZ_{\solid}</m> is projective (here we diverge from the classical setting).
          Consequently, applying <m>\iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(\bullet, \ZZ_\solid)</m> again yields another split exact sequence:
          <me>
            0 \to \bigoplus_I \ZZ_{\solid} \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ_{\solid} \to A \otimes_{\ZZ} \ZZ_{\solid} \to 0.
          </me>
          Since solidification is fully faithful, this implies that our free resolution is itself split. 
          Hence <m>A</m> is projective, and thus free again because <m>\ZZ</m> is a principal ideal domain.
        </p>

      To illustrate that one can really work with the solid modules despite the somewhat abstract definition,

        for some <m>I</m> with <m>|I| \leq \kappa</m>.
        (It is not necessarily to allow a finite product of copies of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> because this is again a product of the same form.)

          where the last term vanishes because <m>Q</m> is torsion. 
          (We will see another proof later in the language of condensed abelian groups; see <xref ref="rem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes-condensed"/>.)

    <proposition xml:id="lem-subobject-of-finitely-generated">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any <m>I</m> with <m>|I| \leq \kappa</m>,
          any finitely generated subobject of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> is itself a product of copies of <m>\ZZ_\solid</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a finitely generated subobject of <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m>. By definition, it sits in a sequence
          <men xml:id="eq-sandwich-free-module">
            \prod_J \ZZ_\solid \to M \to \prod_J \ZZ_\solid
          </men>
          where the first map is surjective and the second map is injective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>g\colon \prod_J \ZZ_\solid \to \prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> be the composition.
          By taking duals (<xref ref="prop-solid-internal-hom"/>), we get a map <m>h \colon \bigoplus_I \ZZ \to \bigoplus_J \ZZ</m>;
          note that we are now considering <em>discrete</em> <m>\ZZ</m>-modules, so we may write <m>\ZZ</m> instead of <m>\ZZ_\solid</m>
          and reason in terms of discrete <m>\ZZ</m>-modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/>, <m>\ima(h)</m> is also a free <m>\ZZ</m>-module, so the source
          <m>\bigoplus_I \ZZ</m> splits as <m>\ker(h)</m> plus a submodule isomorphic to <m>\ima(h)</m>, and both factors are free.
          This splitting transposes to a decomposition of the target <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> as a product into two factors,
          each itself a product of copies of <m>\ZZ_\solid</m>. The point is that we can replace the target <m>\prod_I \ZZ_\solid</m> with a smaller
          target (discarding the dual of <m>\ker(h)</m>) in such a way that <m>M</m> still embeds as a subobject, but the map <m>h</m> is now injective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set <m>Q := \coker(h)</m>. Let <m>\overline{Q}</m> be the quotient of <m>Q</m> by its torsion subgroup; by
          <xref ref="lem-submodule-free-over-PID"/> again, <m>\overline{Q}</m> is again a free <m>\ZZ</m>-module,
          so the target <m>\bigoplus_J \ZZ</m> admits a splitting with <m>\overline{Q}</m> as a direct summand.
          This now transposes to a decomposition of the source <m>\prod_J \ZZ_\solid</m> as a product into two factors,
          each itself a product of copies of <m>\ZZ_\solid</m>, and we can replace the source with one of these factors
          (discarding the dual of <m>\overline{Q}</m>m>) in such a way that we now have a new sequence as in <xref ref="eq-sandwich-free-module"/>, but
          now <m>Q</m> is a torsion <m>\ZZ</m>-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now dualizing the sequence
          <men xml:id="eq-length-1-resolution-of-solid">
            0 \to \bigoplus_I \ZZ \stackrel{h}{\to} \bigoplus_J \ZZ \to Q \to 0
          </men>
          and invoking <xref ref="lem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes"/> yields
          <men xml:id="eq-hom-from-torsion-sequence">
            0 = \iHom_{\ZZ_\solid}(Q \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ_\solid, \ZZ_\solid) \to \prod_J \ZZ_\solid \stackrel{g}{\to} \prod_I \ZZ_\solid.
          </men>
          At this point, we know that in <xref ref="eq-sandwich-free-module"/>, the first map is surjective, the second map is injective,
          and the composition is also injective. Consequently the first map <m>\prod_IJ\ZZ_\solid \to M</m> is an isomorphism, proving the claim.
