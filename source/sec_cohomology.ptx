    <title>Condensed cohomology on compact spaces</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>X \in \CSet</m> and <m>M</m> a topological abelian group, we define the <term>condensed cohomology</term> groups of <m>X</m> with values in <m>M</m>
        to be 
        <me>
          H^i(X, M) := \Ext^i_{\CAb}(\ZZ[X], \underline{M}).
        </me>
        When <m>X \in \Top</m> we may also write <m>H^i_{\cond}(X, M)</m> to mean <m>H^i(\underline{X}, \underline{M})</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-cohomology-of-profinite-in-solid">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>X \in \Prof</m> and <m>M \in \TopAb_\solid</m>, <m>\Ext^i_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{X}], \underline{M}) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is included in <xref ref="lem-identify-solidification-of-free"/>: we have <m>\ZZ[\underline{X}] \cong \prod_i \underline{\ZZ} \cong P_\solid</m>
          and the latter is internally projective in <m>\CAb_\solid</m> by <xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <corollary xml:id="lem-condensed-cohomology-of-profinite">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>X \in \Prof</m> and <m>M \in \Ab</m>, <m>H^i_{\cond}(X, M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This follows from <xref ref="lem-cohomology-of-profinite-in-solid"/> because discrete abelian groups are solid.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-sheaf-to-cond-on-compact-with-discrete-coeffs">
      <statement>
        For <m>X \in \CHaus</m> and <m>M \in \Ab</m>, there are natural (in <m>X</m>) isomorphisms
        <me>
          H^i_{\sheaf}(X, M) \cong H^i_{\cond}(X, M)
        </me>
        where <m>H^i_{\sheaf}(X, \bullet)</m> denotes the usual right derived functors of the global sections functor.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We loosely follow <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-notes"/>, Theorem 3.2.
          Using <xref ref="rem-construct-profinite-cover"/>, we may construct a simplicial hypercovering <m>X_\bullet \to X</m> by objects of <m>\Prof</m>.
          By <xref ref="lem-condensed-cohomology-of-profinite"/>, the terms of this hypercovering are acyclic and so we may compute <m>R\Gamma_{\cond}(X, M)</m> by the Čech complex
          <me>
            0 \to \Gamma(X_0, M) \to \Gamma(X_1, M) \to \cdots.
          </me>
          Since continuous functions from any <m>X_n</m> to the discrete group <m>M</m> are locally constant, the augmented version of this complex is itself a colimit of complexes associated to simplicial hypercoverings of finite sets,
          which are acyclic by <xref ref="lem-condensed-cohomology-of-profinite"/> again. 
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For <m>X \in \CHaus</m>, we can also interpret <m>H^i_{\sheaf}(X,S)</m> as Čech cohomology  (<xref ref="bib-Godement"/>, Théorème 5.10.1).
        In some cases we can also interpret it as singular cohomology, see for example <xref ref="subsec-cohom-CW"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      We next consider coefficients in the topological (not discrete) group <m>\RR</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-cohom-compact-coeffs-in-R">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>X \in \CHaus</m>, <m>H^i_{\cond}(X, \RR) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>. (Note that <m>H^0_{\cond}(X, \RR)</m> is the group of continuous maps <m>S \to \RR</m>.)
          More precisely, for any simplicial hypercovering <m>X_\bullet \to X</m> by objects of <m>\Prof</m>, the augmented Čech complex
          <me>
            0 \to \Cts(X, \RR) \to \Cts(X_0, \RR) \to \Cts(X_1, \RR) \to \cdots
          </me>
          has the property that if we interpret each term as a Banach space for the supremum norm, then for every <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>,
          every cochain <m>f \in \Cts(X_n, \RR)</m> has the form <m>d(g)</m> for some <m>g \in \Cts(X_{n-1}, \RR)</m> with <m>\left| g \right|_{X_{n-1}} \leq (1+\epsilon) \left| f \right|_{X_n}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>X</m> and the <m>X_n</m> are all finite. Then the hypercover splits;
          this means that the augmented Čech complex
          admits a chain homotopy which is <q>combinatorial</q> in the sense that every map is given by pullback along a map of underlying sets.
          (This amounts to a very basic case of the <term>Dold<ndash/>Kan correspondence</term>.)
          In this case the claim evidently holds even for <m>\epsilon = 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the same token, if <m>X</m> and the <m>X_n</m> are all profinite, then we can write the augmented Cech complex as a completed colimit of sequences
          of the previous form. By some elementary analysis (left to the reader), this implies the claim but now with <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the general case, given <m>f \in \Cts(X_n, \RR)</m> nonzero with <m>df = 0</m>,
          for any <m>x \in X</m> we can apply the previous case to the restriction of <m>f</m> to <m>X_n \times_X \{x\}</m>.
          We may then deduce the general case by spreading the results out using Tietze's extension theorem,
          invoking compactness to see that the spread out functions cover <m>X</m>,
          and constructing a suitable partition of unity argument to patch together the local choices.
          See <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-notes"/>, Theorem 3.3 for the detailed argument.

      <p>
        A <term>CW complex</term> is a topological space obtained as a colimit <m>X_0 \subseteq X_1 \subseteq \cdots</m>
        in which each <m>X_k</m> is obtained from <m>X_{k-1}</m> by glueing in some copies of the <m>k</m>-dimensional ball, with the boundaries contained in <m>X_{k-1}</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\LCAb</m> denote the category of sequential locally compact abelian groups.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Every <m>A \in \LCAb</m> has the form <m>\RR^n \times A'</m> for some nonnegative integer <m>n</m> and some <m>A' \in \LCAb</m>
            admitting a compact open subgroup. In particular, <m>A'</m> is an extension of a discrete abelian group by a compact group.

          <li>
            Let <m>\TT \cong \RR/\ZZ \in \Top</m> be the circle group.
            The Pontryagin duality functor 
            <me>
              A \mapsto D(A) := \Hom_{\LCAb}(A, \TT)
            </me>
            takes values in <m>\LCAb</m> and induces a contravariant autoduality on this category. In particular, there is a functorial isomorphism <m>A \to D(D(A))</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The functor <m>D</m> restricts to a duality between discrete abelian groups and compact abelian groups.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Hewitt-Ross"/>, specifically Theorem 24.30 for the first point, Theorem 24.8 for the second, and Theorem 23.17 for the third.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-cohom-of-torus">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any discrete abelian group <m>M</m> and any at most countable index set <m>I</m>, we have
          <me>
            R\Hom_{\CAb}(\TT, \underline{M}) = \bigoplus_I M[-1].
          </me>
          More precisely, the map from right to left has the form
          <me>
            M[-1] = R\Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{\ZZ}[1], M) \cong R\Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{\TT}, M) \to R\Hom_{\CAb}(\prod_I \underline{\TT}, M)
          </me>
          where the passage from <m>\ZZ</m> to <m>\TT</m> is the connecting homomorphism from the exact sequence of topological abelian groups:
          <me>
            0 \to \ZZ \to \RR \to \TT \to 0
          </me>
          and the map <m>\underline{\TT} \to \prod_I \underline{\TT}</m> varies over the insertion maps.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>\TT</m> is a compact CW complex,
          this can be deduced from <xref ref="thm-sheaf-to-cond-on-compact-with-discrete-coeffs"/> and <xref ref="thm-cohom-CW-complex"/>;
          but it can also be seen more directly as follows.
          Since <m>\underline{M}</m> is solid by <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>,
          we have <m>R\Hom_{\CAb}(\prod_I \underline{\RR}, \underline{M})</m> by <xref ref="cor-solid-R-module-is-zero-monomorphism"/>.
          Meanwhile, via <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/> we have 
          <me>
            R\Hom_{\CAb}(\prod_I \underline{\ZZ}, \underline{M}) = R\Hom_{\ZZ_\solid}(\prod_I \ZZ_\solid, M_\solid) = \bigoplus_I M[0]
          </me>
          because <m>\prod_I \underline{\ZZ}</m> is projective in <m>\Mod_{\ZZ_\solid}</m>.
          This yields the claim.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The assignment <m>A \mapsto \underline{A}</m> defines a fully faithful functor from the bounded derived category of <m>\LCAb</m> to the derived category of <m>\CAb</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          In light of point 1 of <xref ref="thm-LCAb-structure"/>, it suffices to check that <m>R\Hom_{\LCAb}(A,B) \cong R\Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{A}, \underline{B})</m>
          when each of <m>A,B</m> is either compact, discrete, or isomorphic to <m>\RR</m>. We break down the argument as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>A</m> is discrete. Using resolutions and filtered colimits we may reduce to the case <m>A = \ZZ</m>.
          In this case, <m>A</m> and <m>\underline{A}</m> are projective in their respective categories and the result is clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose next that <m>A</m> is compact. By taking a resolution of the dual group, we may reduce to the case where <m>A = \prod_I \TT</m> with <m>I</m> at most countable.
          At this point, when <m>B</m> is discrete we may deduce the desired isomorphism by comparing <xref ref="lem-cohom-of-torus"/> with <xref ref="bib-Hoffmann-Spitzweck"/>, Example 4.11;
          when <m>B = \RR</m> we may instead compare <xref ref="thm-cohom-compact-coeffs-in-R"/> with <xref ref="bib-Hoffmann-Spitzweck"/>, Proposition 4.15 for the same effect.
          Combining these and using the exact sequence
          <men xml:id="eq-exact-seq-for-torus">
            0 \to \ZZ \to \RR \to \TT \to 0
          </men>
          we deduce the claim also when <m>B = \TT</m>, and consequently when <m>B = \prod_I \TT</m>; again we may formally promote this to the general case of <m>B</m> compact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, to resolve the case <m>A = \RR</m> we may use <xref ref="eq-exact-seq-for-torus"/> to reduce to the previously treated cases <m>A = \ZZ</m> (discrete)
          and <m>A = \TT</m> (compact).
