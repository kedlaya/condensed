  <title>Explicit solidifications</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we show that the functor defined in <xref ref="thm-solid-to-condensed"/> from solid abelian groups as defined in <xref ref="sec_solid1"/>.
      to solid condensed abelian groups is an equivalence of categories.
      This will allow us to employ the language of solid abelian groups while still drawing conclusions about condensed abelian groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the process, we will also identify the solidifications of the sequence space <m>P</m> and of the groups <m>\ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m>.
      Even if one is content to work solely with solid objects in the language of condensed abelian groups, these identifications are crucial to have any control
      over the solid objects.

    <title>Setting up a comparison of solidifications</title>
    <p>
      Our first goal is to show that the coordinate map <m>c \colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> induces an isomorphism <m>P_\solid \cong \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>
      (<xref ref="cor-solidification-of-P"/>).
      Since both <m>P</m> and <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> correspond to sequential topological abelian groups (see <xref ref="def-internally-projective-object"/>), 
      we can interpret <m>c</m> as a map in that category.
      However, to overcome a subtle topological issue (<xref ref="rem-map-does-not-extend-to-unbounded"/>) we need to refactor this map as follows.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-strict-factorization">
      <p>
        Note that <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> admits the subobject
        <md>
          \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} := \colim_{n \in \NN} \prod_\NN \underline{\{-n,\dots,n\}}
        </md>.
        In terms of evaluations at <m>S \in \Prof</m>, <m>\left(\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}\right)(S)</m> consists of continuous maps <m>S \to \prod_\NN \ZZ</m>,
        or equivalently families of continuous maps <m>S \to \ZZ</m> indexed by <m>\NN</m>. Each of these maps has bounded image, but
        <m>\left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right)(S)</m> picks out the families with <em>uniformly</em> bounded image.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the explicit description of <m>\ZZ[\NN_\infty]</m> (<xref ref="exa-module-ring-topological-space"/>),
        we can factor <m>c\colon P \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> through <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m> to yield a sequence of inclusions
        <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-p-to-product">
          P \stackrel{c}{\to} \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}
        </md>.
        Namely, <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}) = \prod_\NN \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\ZZ})</m> consists of infinite families of null sequences in <m>\ZZ</m>,
        while <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ})</m> picks out those families whose images are uniformly bounded.
        The sequences corresponding to the factors of the map <m>c</m> only take values in <m>\{0,1\}</m>, so they form a family of the latter form.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Fortunately, it is easy to compare the solidifications of <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m> and <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="cor-replace-prod-with-bounded-solid">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The map <m>\left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right)_\solid \to \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ} \right)_\solid</m> is an isomorphism,
          and likewise at the level of derived solidifications.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By analogy with the construction of <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m>, we define
          <md>
            \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\RR} := \colim_{n \in \NN} \prod_\NN \underline{[-n,n]}
          </md>;
          we will construct an isomorphism (at the level of topological abelian groups)
          <md>
            \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}\right) / \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right) \cong \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\RR} \right) / \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\RR} \right)
          </md>.
          Since the right-hand side carries an evident <m>\underline{\RR}</m>-module structure, so does the left-hand side. 
          By <xref ref="cor-solid-R-module-is-zero-monomorphism"/>, this will yield the claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed isomorphism is formally equivalent to the claim that
          <md>
            \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\RR} \right) / \left( \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \right) \cong \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\RR} \right) / \left( \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ} \right)
          </md>;
          we get this isomorphism of abelian groups because <m>\RR/\ZZ</m> is compact.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <title>A comparison of solidifications</title>
    <p>
      We now finish comparing the effect of solidification across the terms of <xref ref="eq-p-to-product"/>.
      The strategy is to build a diagram that allows us to exploit the fact that <m>\Delta\colon P \to P</m>
      becomes an isomorphism after solidification.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-diagram-for-Delta">
      <p>
        Let <m>\Delta\colon \ZZ[\NN] \to \ZZ[\NN]</m> denote the map <m>[n] \mapsto [n]-[n+1]</m>.
        We then obtain a commutative diagram
        <figure>

            <latex-image>
              \xymatrix{

               \ZZ[\NN] \otimes \ZZ[\NN] \ar[r] &amp; \ZZ[\NN]

          </image>
        </figure>
      of discrete abelian groups in which the top row maps <m>[m] \otimes [n]</m> to <m>[n]</m> if <m>m = n</m> and 0 otherwise,
      and the bottom row maps <m>[m] \otimes [n]</m> to <m>[n]</m> if <m>m \leq n</m> and 0 otherwise.
      Note that the two rows are equalized by <m>\ZZ[\NN] \to \ZZ[\NN] \otimes \ZZ[\NN]</m> via <m>[n] \mapsto [n] \otimes [n]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By encoding the various maps in terms of maps of profinite sets via the isomorphism
      <m>\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty \times \NN_\infty}] \cong \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \otimes \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]</m>,
      we promote the previous diagram to a new diagram:
        <figure>
          <image width="50%">
            <latex-image>
              \xymatrix{

                P \otimes P \ar[r] &amp; P
              }
            </latex-image>
          </image>
        </figure>
        where again the rows are equalized by a map <m>P \to P \otimes P</m> acting via <m>[n] \mapsto [n] \otimes [n]</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-diagram-p-to-bd">
      <statement>

          There exists a commutative diagram in <m>\CAb</m> of the form

          in which the rows are compatibly split surjections (that is, the splittings can be chosen to again form a commuting square with the same columns).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By imitating the construction of the diagram from <xref ref="def-diagram-for-Delta"/>, we obtain a diagram of the form
          <figure>
            <image width="50%">
              <latex-image>
                \xymatrix{
                  P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \ar[r] \ar^{\Delta \otimes \id}[d] &amp; \prod_\NN^{\bd}  \underline{\ZZ} \ar@{=}[d] \\
                  P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \ar[r] &amp; \prod_\NN^{\bd}  \underline{\ZZ}
                }
              </latex-image>
            </image>
          </figure>
          where now the top row is <m>[m] \otimes (c_0,c_1,\dots) \mapsto (0,\dots,0,c_m,0,\dots)</m>,
          the bottom row is <m>[m] \otimes (c_0,c_1,\dots) \mapsto (0,\dots,0,c_m,c_{m+1},\dots)</m>,
          and the two rows are equalized by a map <m>P \to P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m> acting via <m>[n] \mapsto [n] \otimes c([n])</m>.
          The bottom row is split by a map of the form <m>s \mapsto [0] \otimes s</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get what we need, we must verify that the top row
          <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-Delta-top-row">
            P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}
          </md>
          factors through <m>c</m>. The compatible splitting of the resulting top row will be guaranteed by the fact that since <m>c</m> is injective,  
          the composition <m>P \to P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to P</m> will again be the identity.
        </p>
        <p> 
          More precisely, we will show that that the formula
          <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-bilinear-map-from-P">
            \left( \sum_n c_n [n], (d_n)_n \right) \mapsto \sum_n c_n d_n [n]
          </md>
          defines a continuous bilinear map <m>P \times\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ} \to P </m>
          at the level of topological abelian groups. 
          Composing <xref ref="eq-bilinear-map-from-P"/> with <m>c</m> will then yield the map <xref ref="eq-Delta-top-row"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          To check continuity of <xref ref="eq-bilinear-map-from-P"/>,
          it will suffice to check that every null sequence is mapped to a null sequence.
          For this, note first that a sequence of sums <m>\sum_n a_n [n] \in P</m> is a null sequence
          iff <m>\sum_n |a_n|</m> is uniformly bounded (say by <m>n_1</m>) and for each fixed <m>n</m>, <m>a_n</m> is eventually zero.
          Meanwhile, a sequence of sequences <m>(b_n)_n \in\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m> is a null sequence if and only if
          <m>\sup_n \{|b_n|\}</m> is uniformly bounded (say by <m>n_2</m>) and for each fixed <m>n</m>, <m>b_n</m> is eventually zero.
          From this, we see that <m>\sum_n |a_nb_n|</m> is uniformly bounded by <m>n_1n_2</m> and for each fixed <m>n</m>, <m>a_nb_n</m> is eventually zero;
          that is, <m>\sum_n a_n b_n[n]</m> is a null sequence in <m>P</m>, proving the claim.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark xml:id="rem-map-does-not-extend-to-unbounded">
      <p>
        The continuous bilinear map <xref ref="eq-bilinear-map-from-P"/>
        does not extend continuously to <m>P \times \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>: the sequence <m>[n] \otimes nc([n])</m> is a null sequence but its image in <m>P</m>
        is the sequence <m>n[n]</m> which is not a null sequence. This explains why the insertion of <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m> in
        <xref ref="def-strict-factorization"/> was necessary.

        <p>
          We solidify the diagram in <xref ref="lem-diagram-p-to-bd"/> to obtain

            <image width="50%">
              <latex-image>
                \xymatrix{

          </figure>
          where again the rows are compatibly split surjections. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We check that the left vertical arrow in the diagram is an isomorphism.
          By Yoneda's lemma, it suffices to check that this arrow induces an isomorphism after taking internal Homs into any <m>N \in \CAb_\solid</m>.
          To see this, we apply Hom-tensor adjunction to write
          <md>
            \iHom_{\CAb}\left( P \otimes \prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N\right) 
            = \iHom_{\CAb}\left( P, \iHom_{\CAb}\left(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N\right)\right)
          </md>
          and then invoke <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/> to see that <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}, N)</m> is solid.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point we conclude that <m>c_\solid</m> is a split surjection.
          We now use the fact that rows are <em>compatibly</em> split to see that tracing clockwise from <m>P_\solid</m>
          (using the chosen splitting in the bottom row) is the identity, which means that <m>c_\solid</m> is also injective.

    <title>More comparisons of solidifications</title>
    <p>
      It still remains to confirm that every solid condensed abelian group arises from a solid abelian group. For this,
      we calculate some more solidifications using a process similar to the computation of <m>P_\solid</m>;
      however, now we may take a shortcut and compare things to <m>P_\solid</m> rather than directly to <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>.

    <definition xml:id="def-construct-map-P-to-monoid">
      <p>
        For <m>S \in \Prof</m> infinite, we construct a morphism <m>g\colon P \to \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> as follows.
        Per <xref ref="rem-change-pro-system-to-sequential"/>, we may write <m>S</m> as a sequential inverse limit of finite sets with surjective transition maps:
        <m>S = \varprojlim_{n \in \NN} S_n</m>. Let <m>\pi_n\colon S \to S_n</m> denote the projection map.
      </p>
      <p>
        We first inductively choose subsets <m>T_n \subset S_n</m> and maps <m>i_n\colon T_n \to S</m> subject to the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each composition <m>\pi_n \circ i_n \colon T_n \to S \to S_n</m> coincides with the inclusion <m>T_n \subseteq S_n</m>.

          <li>
            Each <m>T_n</m> is the complement of the images of the maps <m>\pi_n \circ i_m\colon T_m \to S \to S_n</m> for all <m>m \lt n</m>.

        Let <m>j_n\colon S_n \to S</m> be the map obtained by collating the maps <m>i_m</m> for <m>m \leq n</m>.
        That is, each element of <m>S_{n}</m> projects to <m>T_m</m> for a unique choice of <m>m</m>,
        and then we apply <m>i_m</m> for that choice of <m>m</m>.

        If we run the construction in <xref ref="def-construct-map-P-to-monoid"/> with <m>S = \NN_\infty</m>, then all of the choices are forced: we must take <m>T_n = \{n\}</m>
        and <m>i_n</m> to be the map <m>n \mapsto n</m>. In this case <m>j_{n-1} \circ \pi_{n-1} \circ i_n = 0</m>, so we recover precisely the map <m>P \to \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]</m>
        splitting the projection.

        From the construction in <xref ref="def-construct-map-P-to-monoid"/>, we see that <m>g</m> induces a bijection between <m>\ZZ</m>-valued measures on <m>S</m> and functions <m>\NN \to \ZZ</m>:
        the value of the resulting function at <m>x \in T_n</m> computes the measure of the preimage of <m>x</m> via <m>S \to S_n</m>.
        In this context, we will not need an analogue of replacing <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> with <m>\prod_\NN^{\bd} \underline{\ZZ}</m>,
        ultimately because <m>\ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> is itself locally compact (<xref ref="exa-module-ring-topological-space"/>).

    <title>A characterization of solid condensed abelian groups</title>
    <p>
      We conclude by asserting that every solid condensed abelian group <q>is</q> (better, is represented by) a solid abelian group.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The functor <m>\Ab_\solid \to \CAb_\solid</m> from <xref ref="thm-solid-to-condensed"/> is an exact equivalence compatible with limits and colimits,
          <m>\Hom</m> and <m>\iHom</m>, <m>\Ext^i</m> and <m>\iExt^i</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>, and <m>\otimes_\solid</m>.
          Moreover, it extends to a corresponding equivalence of derived categories.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The category <m>\CAb</m> admits the objects <m>\ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m> as a family of compact generators.
          By <xref ref="lem-identify-solidification-of-free"/>,
          <m>\CAb_\solid</m> admits <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> as a single compact generator,
          so we can identify any object as a colimit of a diagram arising from <m>\Ab_{\solid}</m>; this yield essential surjectivity.
          Everything else follows from <xref ref="thm-solid-to-condensed"/> and <xref ref="cor-solid-embedding-exact"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/> has the effect that we can replace the study of <m>\CAb_\solid</m>
        with the equivalent but conceptually simpler category <m>\Ab_{\solid}</m>, whose definition contains no topology.
        One can also go in the opposite direction, as in the following.

    <remark xml:id="rem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes-condensed">
      <p>
        We give an alternate proof of <xref ref="lem-hom-from-torsion-vanishes"/> in the setting of condensed abelian groups.
        In this language, the statement is that for <m>Q</m> a torsion abelian group,
        <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ}) = 0</m>. To prove this, evaluate at <m>S \in \Prof</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \iHom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q}, \underline{\ZZ})(S) &amp;= \Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\ZZ})
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp;= \Hom_{\CAb}(\underline{Q}, \iHom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\ZZ}))
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; = \Hom_{\TopAb}(Q, \Cts(S, \ZZ))
          </mrow>
        </md>
        using <xref ref="eq-ihom-S-to-X"/> at the last step.
        But already <m>\Hom_{\Ab}(Q, \Cts(S, \ZZ)) = 0</m> because <m>Q</m> cannot admit a nonzero map to any torsion-free abelian group.
