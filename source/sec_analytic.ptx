  <title>Analytic rings</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we introduce the concept of a <term>analytic ring</term>, which in some sense gives the precise category of base rings over
      which one can do analytic geometry. This will correspond roughly to specifying an underlying condensed commutative ring and a category of <q>complete modules</q> over this ring.
      We have seen a few examples already coming from solid abelian groups, but using an analogue of solidification we will generate many more,
      including a key example associated to the real numbers.

    <p>
      Note: a previous version of these notes used the term <term>liquid</term>, but this created a terminological conflict
      with <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-notes"/>,
      in which <q>liquid</q> refers to a class of analytic rings that is not covered in these notes
      (see <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-analytic"/>, or for a brief taste <xref ref="bib-liquid"/>).
      To resolve this, we are now using the term <term>coalescent</term>. See
      <xref ref="rem-gaseous-terminology"/> for some discussion of the metaphors underlying the terminology.

    <title>Analytic rings</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        By a <term>condensed (commutative) ring</term>, we will mean a commutative ring object in the symmetric monoidal category <m>\CAb</m>.
        Similarly, for <m>R</m> a condensed commutative ring (meaning a commutative ring object in <m>\CAb</m>),
        by a <term>condensed <m>R</m>-module</term> we will mean an <m>R</m>-module object in <m>\CAb</m>
        Write <m>\Mod_R</m> for the category of condensed <m>R</m>-modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        This notation must be used carefully to avoid creating confusion.
        For instance, for <m>R</m> a discrete commutative ring,
        there is a natural full embedding <m>\Mod_R \to \Mod_{\underline{R}}</m>
        which is not an equivalence: its essential image consists solely of the discrete <m>R</m>-modules.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      To define an analytic ring, we specify a base ring and a category of <q>complete</q> modules over this base ring.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-analytic-ring">
      <p>
        A <term>pre-analytic ring</term> is a pair <m>R = (R^{\triangleright}, \Mod_R)</m> where <m>R^\triangleright</m> 
        is a condensed commutative ring and <m>\Mod_R</m> is a full subcategory of <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m>
        closed under limits, colimits, and extensions, and satisfying
        <m>\iExt^i_{R^\triangleright}(M, N) \in \Mod_R</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>
        whenever <m>M \in \Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}, N \in \Mod_R</m>.
        A morphism of pre-analytic rings <m>R \to S</m> is a morphism <m>R^{\triangleright} \to S^{\triangleright}</m> of condensed commutative rings
        such that for any <m>M \in \Mod_S</m>, the pullback of <m>M</m> from <m>\Mod_{S^{\triangleright}}</m> to <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> belongs to <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <term>analytic ring</term> is a pre-analytic ring 
        in which in addition <m>R^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_R</m>.
        We then have a symmetric monoidal structure on <m>\Mod_R</m> with unit <m>R^{\triangleright}</m> (see <xref ref="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic"/>).
        A morphism of analytic rings is a morphism of the underlying pre-analytic rings.
        Let <m>\AnRing</m> denote the category of analytic rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all underlying objects of <m>\Mod_R</m> belong to <m>\CAb_\solid</m>, we refer to the result as a <term>solid analytic ring</term>;
        note that it is not enough to simply have <m>R^{\triangleright} \in \CAb_\solid</m> (<xref ref="rem-discrete-not-solid"/>).
        Let <m>\AnRing_\solid</m> denote the full subcategory of <m>\AnRing</m> consisting of solid analytic rings;
        we are free to describe solid analytic rings using the interpretation of <m>\CAb_\solid</m> in terms of solid abelian groups (<xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Given a pre-analytic ring, the embedding functor <m>\Mod_R \to \Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> admits a left adjoint
        which we will call <em>analytic completion</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, forming the analytic completion of <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}]</m> for <m>T \in \Prof</m> yields 
        an object we call <m>R[\underline{T}]</m>; these objects form a set
        of compact (but not necessarily projective) generators of the category <m>\Mod_R</m>.
        A morphism of pre-analytic rings can then be interpreted as a map <m>R^{\triangleright} \to S^{\triangleright}</m>
        such that for each <m>T \in \Prof</m>,
        the image of <m>S[\underline{T}]</m> in <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> via restriction of scalars
        belongs to <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We define a tensor product <m>\otimes</m> on <m>\Mod_R</m> by taking the tensor product in <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m>
        and then applying analytic completion to get back to <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic">
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a pre-analytic ring and let <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m> be the analytic completion of <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>.
        Since <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} R^{\triangleright}</m> and <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>
        have the same analytic completion, 
        the multiplication map <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} R^{\triangleright} \to R^{\triangleright}</m>
        induces a map <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \to \hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>.
        That is, <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m> canonically promotes to an <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>-algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, for <m>M \in \Mod_R</m>, we have <m>M = R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m>;
        since <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m> and <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m>
        have the same analytic completion, we also have <m>M = \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m>.
        Consequently, the <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>-module structure on <m>M</m> canonically promotes to a <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>-module structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in this vein, for <m>M \in \Mod_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}, N \in \Mod_R</m> we have 
        <md>
          <mrow>
             \Hom_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
              &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
              &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \hat{\otimes}_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
              &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; = \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
          </mrow>
        </md>.
        (The introduction of <m>\hat{\otimes}_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> in place of <m>\otimes_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> is where we are using the fact that
        the target <m>N</m> belongs to <m>\Mod_R</m>.)
        Since this applies to <m>M \in \Mod_R</m> in particular,
        it confirms that <m>\Mod_R \to \Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> factors through <m>\Mod_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the same logic with <m>M</m> replaced by <m>M \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m>,
        we see that also <m>\iHom_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) \cong \iHom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)</m>.
        However, note that it is not automatic that
        <m>
          \Ext^i_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) \cong \Ext^i_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
        </m>
        for <m>i \gt 0</m> (or the corresponding statement for internal Ext) <em>unless</em> we know that <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m> coincides with the <em>derived</em>
        analytic completion of <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this will be true in many circumstances (<xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/>).
        When this occurs, <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \hat{\otimes}^L_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} = \hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>
        and we can argue as above to see that for <m>M \in \Mod_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}, N \in \Mod_R</m> we have 
        <me>
          R\Hom_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) = R\Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
        </me>.
        In particular,
        <me>
          \Ext^i_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) = \Ext^i_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
        </me>;
        by the same logic with <m>M</m> replaced by <m>M \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m>, we also have
        <me>
          \iExt^i_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) = \iExt^i_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
        </me>
        so in particular <m>\iExt^i_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N) \in \Mod_R</m>.
        We conclude the pair <m>\hat{R} := (\hat{R}^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{\hat{R}} := \Mod_R)</m> is an analytic ring.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The notation <m>R = (R^{\triangleright}, \Mod_R)</m> is meant to simulate the notation used by Huber in his development of the theory of <term>adic spaces</term>.
        We will integrate this theory into our work later, by showing that Huber pairs can be viewed as a full subcategory of solid analytic rings (<xref ref="prop-Huber-pair-to-solid-analytic"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-filtered-colimit-analytic">
      <p>
        To take a colimit of a system of analytic rings <m>(R_i^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{R_i})</m>, 
        one first takes the colimit in pre-analytic rings:
        the base ring is <m>\colim_i R_i^{\triangleright}</m> and the module category is the limit of <m>\Mod_{R_i}</m>.
        One then replaces the base ring with its analytic completion as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <em>filtered</em> colimits, the second step is not necessary: if <m>i \leq j</m> then <m>R_j^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_{R_i}</m>,
        so the colimit automatically belongs to <m>\Mod_{R_i}</m> for every <m>i</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-more-homotopical-rings">
      <p>
        For some applications, it is useful to extend the notion of an analytic ring to the case where the base is no longer a condensed commutative ring,
        but a more homotopical object such as a <term>animated ring</term>, a <term>simplicial ring</term>, or an <term><m>E_\infty</m>-commutative ring</term>.
        We will not touch on these topics in these notes.

    <title>Examples of analytic rings</title>
    <example xml:id="exa-discrete-analytic-ring">
      <p>
        For every commutative ring <m>A</m>, the pair <m>(\underline{A}, \Mod_{\underline{A}})</m> is an analytic ring.
        An analytic ring of this form will be said to be <term>discrete</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, if <m>A</m> is a condensed commutative ring, we may treat <m>(A, \Mod_A)</m> as an analytic ring.
        It is natural to label this also as <m>A</m>, so that the two resulting interpretations of <m>\Mod_A</m> coincide.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-discrete-not-solid">
      <p>
        Beware that while discrete abelian groups are solid, discrete analytic rings are not solid analytic rings
        because the module category includes non-solid objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that for <m>A</m> a commutative ring, the pair <m>(\underline{A}, \Mod_A)</m> (i.e., taking the discrete modules) is not an analytic ring: 
        it fails the condition that <m>\iHom_{\underline{A}}(M, N) \in \Mod_A</m> for <m>M \in \Mod_{\underline{A}}, N \in \Mod_A</m>.
        For example, take <m>R = \ZZ, M = \bigoplus_\NN \underline{\ZZ}, N = \underline{\ZZ}</m>;
        we then have <m>\iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(M, N) = \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> which is not a discrete <m>\ZZ</m>-module.
        This is corrected for using solid modules instead (<xref ref="exa-solid-analytic-ring"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-solid-analytic-ring">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a condensed commutative ring,
        define the category of <term>solid <m>R</m>-modules</term> by
        <me>
          \Mod_{R\solid} := \Mod_R(\CAb_\solid) = \Mod_R \times_{\CAb} \CAb_\solid.
        </me>
        By <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>, <m>(R, \Mod_{R \solid})</m> is a pre-analytic ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>R</m> is itself solid as a condensed abelian group, then <m>(R, \Mod_{R \solid})</m> is an analytic ring.
        By <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/>, this applies if <m>R</m> is discrete;
        comparing with <xref ref="exa-discrete-analytic-ring"/> gives us examples of analytic rings where the underlying ring is the same but the module category is different.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative ring and <m>f \in R</m> not a zero-divisor, 
        let <m>\hat{R}_{\solid}</m> denote the classical <m>f</m>-completion of <m>R</m> in <m>\Ab_\solid</m>
        (i.e., the usual <m>f</m>-adic completion carrying the <m>f</m>-adic topology). 
        The pair consisting of <m>\hat{R}_\solid</m> and the category of derived <m>f</m>-complete objects in <m>\Mod_{R \solid}</m> is a solid analytic ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the pair consisting of <m>\hat{R}_\solid[1/f]</m> and the category of derived <m>f</m>-complete objects
        in <m>\Mod_{R \solid}</m> on which <m>f</m> is invertible is a solid analytic ring.

  <subsection>
    <title>Coalescence</title>
    <p>
      We define a new process for constructing pre-analytic rings.
      We start with a bit of motivation.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative topological ring, <m>f \in R</m> an element, <m>M</m> a Hausdorff topological <m>R</m>-module, and <m>(a_n)</m> a sequence in <m>M</m>,
        we say that <m>(a_n)</m> is <term>summable against <m>f</m></term> if the series <m>\sum_n a_n f^n</m> converges in <m>M</m>.
        In this language, <m>M</m> is classically <m>f</m>-complete if and only every series is summable against <m>f</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, <m>M</m> is solid if and only if every null sequence is summable against <m>f=1</m>.
        This suggests that we might find it productive to also enforce summability of null sequences against other <m>f</m>.
        For example, in <m>\RR</m> every null sequence is summable against any <m>f</m> with <m>|f| \lt 1</m>, but not in general against <m>f=1</m>.

        As in <xref ref="eq-resolve-cofinite-mod-Z"/>, we have an internally projective resolution of <m>\coker(\Delta_f)/R</m> of length 1:
        <men xml:id="eq-resolve-coker-mod-R-liquefaction">
          0 \to P \otimes R \stackrel{\Delta_f}{\to} (P/\ZZ) \otimes R \to \coker(\Delta_f)/R \to 0
        </men>
        which means that if <m>M</m> is concentrated in degrees <m>[a,b]</m>, then its derived <m>f</m>-coalescence is concentrated in degrees <m>[a-1,b]</m>.
        In particular, for <m>M \in \Mod_R</m> the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence is concentrated in degrees <m>-1</m> and <m>0</m>,
        with the term in degree <m>-1</m> being <m>\iHom_R(\coker(\Delta_f)/R, M)</m>;
        this makes it clear that this term is nonzero for instance when <m>M = \coker(\Delta_f)/R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of the resolution <xref ref="eq-resolve-coker-mod-R-liquefaction"/> has the following important consequence for the construction of analytic rings.
        Let <m>R_0 = (R_0^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{R_0})</m> be an analytic ring,
        choose <m>f \in R_0(*)</m>, and let <m>\Mod_{R_1} := \Mod_{R_0 \liquid f}</m> be the full subcategory of <m>f</m>-coalescent objects in <m>\Mod_{R_0}</m>.
        Then the underived <m>f</m>-coalescence <m>R_1^{\triangleright}</m> of <m>R_0^{\triangleright}</m> has the property that for any <m>M \in \Mod_{R_1}</m>,
        <m>\Ext^1_{R_0^{\triangleright}}(R_1^\triangleright, M) = 0</m>: for any exact sequence in <m>\Mod_{R_0^{\triangleright}}</m> of the form
        <me>
          0 \to M \to M' \to R_1^{\triangleright} \to 0
        </me>
        we have <m>M' \in \Mod_{R_1}</m> by <xref ref="prop-liquefaction"/>, so any splitting of the pullback sequence
        <me>
          0 \to M \to M' \times_{R_1^{\triangleright}} R_0^{\triangleright} \to R_0^{\triangleright} \to 0
        </me>
        (which exists because <m>R_0^{\triangleright}</m> is projective as a module over itself)
        extends by adjunction to a splitting of the original sequence.
        By replacing <m>M</m> with <m>\iHom_{R_0^{\triangleright}}(R_0^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}], M)</m>,
        we formally upgrade this conclusion to assert that <m>\iExt^1_{R_0^{\triangleright}}(R_1^\triangleright, M) = 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this, we see that <m>R_1^{\triangleright}</m> is also the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>R_0^{\triangleright}</m>.
        That is, the issue
        raised in <xref ref="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic"/> does not arise in this context,
        and so <m>R_1 = (R_1^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{R_1})</m> is itself an analytic ring. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By similar logic, starting from the fact that <m>P</m> is internally projective in <m>\CAb</m> (<xref ref="prop-internally-projective"/>),
        we may see that the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>P \otimes R_0^{\triangleright}</m> equals <m>P \otimes R_1^{\triangleright}</m> placed in degree 0,
        which is again internally projective in <m>\Mod_{R_1}</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The operation of <m>f</m>-coalescence bears a strong formal resemblance to derived <m>f</m>-completion.
      This drives the next few remarks.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        If <m>S \to R</m> is a homomorphism of commutative ring objects in <m>\CAb</m>, then for any <m>f \in S</m>
        we have 
        <me>
          \Mod_{R \liquid f} = \Mod_{S \liquid f} \times_{\Mod_S} \Mod_R
        </me>.
        This applies in particular when <m>f = 1</m>, in which case we may take <m>S = \ZZ</m> to obtain
        <me>
          \Mod_{R \liquid 1} = \Mod_{R\solid}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that for <m>M \in \Mod_R</m>, forming the <m>f</m>-coalescence <m>M_{\liquid f}</m> commutes with restriction of scalars from <m>S</m> to <m>R</m>,
        so there is no ambiguity in the notation. However, this is not necessarily true of the <em>derived</em> <m>f</m>-coalescence unless <m>S</m> is projective in <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For <m>f,g \in R</m>, (derived) <m>f</m>-coalescence commutes with (derived) <m>g</m>-coalescence because the composition in either order can be written
        in a symmetric form using the Koszul complex associated to <m>\Delta_f</m> and <m>\Delta_g</m>. 
        In particular, (derived) <m>f</m>-coalescence acts on the (derived) category of <m>g</m>-coalescent modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, for any subset <m>S \subset R</m>, taking <m>R</m> together with the full subcategory 
        <m>\Mod_{R \liquid S} := \bigcap_{f \in S} \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m> forms a pre-analytic ring.
        An important special case is when <m>1 \in S</m>; thanks to <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>,
        we can treat this case in the language of solid abelian groups.

    <title>The core of an analytic ring</title>
    <p>
      We study the effect of coalescing with respect to different elements.
      This involves picking up the thread from <xref ref="rem-infinite-series"/>, now
      algebraizing various statements about summability of null sequences against <m>f</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-f-liquid-to-scale-null">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a condensed commutative ring and choose <m>f \in R(*)</m> and <m>M \in \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m>.
          Then the map on <m>\iHom_R(R[T], M)</m> induced by <m>R[T] \stackrel{T \mapsto fT}{\to} R[T]</m> carries
          <m>\iHom_R(P \otimes R, M)</m> into itself.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>S \in \Prof</m>, we must check that we get a map on <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], \iHom_{\CAb}(P, M))</m>;
          using Hom-tensor adjunction, we may rewrite this as <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, \Hom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], M))</m>.
          Since again <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], M) \in \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m>,
          we formally reduce to the case where <m>S</m> is a singleton.
          The claimed statement now becomes the observation that for any null sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> in <m>M</m>,
          the inclusion <m>M \in \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m> means that the sequence <m>(m_0, f m_1, \dots)</m> is summable against 1,
          and so must itself be a null sequence.

          Suppose that the map on <m>\iHom_R(R[T], M)</m> induced by <m>R[T] \stackrel{T \mapsto gT}{\to} R[T]</m> carries

      <proof>
        <p>
          We algebraize the following statement: given a null sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m>,
          if we know that <m>(m_0, f_1 m_1, \dots)</m> is again a null sequence and that every null sequence is summable against <m>g</m>,
          we may conclude that the original sequence is summable against <m>fg</m>.

        <p>
          Let <m>h_g^* \colon \iHom_R(P \otimes R, M) \to \iHom_R(P \otimes R, M)</m> be the map induced by
          <m>R[T] \stackrel{T \mapsto gT}{\to} R[T]</m>, whose existence has been assumed.
          Note that the notation is mnemonic in nature: we are not assuming the existence of a map <m>h_g</m> on <m>P \times R</m>,
          but <m>h_g^*</m> functions as the <q>virtual pullback</q> by such a nonexistent map.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have an equality of maps on <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(P, M) \cong \iHom_R(P \otimes R, M)</m>:
          <me>
            \Delta_f^* \circ h_g^* = h_g^* \circ \Delta_{fg}^*

          both compositions have the effect
          <me>
            (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto (m_0-fgm_1, gm_1-fg^2m_2, \dots).
          </me>.
          Next, define the map
          <me>
            \lambda\colon P \to P, \qquad [0] \to 0, [n+1] \mapsto [n]
          </me>

          <me>
            \lambda^* \oplus h_g^*\colon \iHom_R(P \otimes R, M) \to \iHom_R((P \oplus P) \otimes R, M)
          </me>
          where <m>\lambda^*\colon \iHom_{\CAb}(P, M) \to \iHom_{\CAb}(P, M)</m> is a genuine pullback.
          The map <m> \lambda^* \oplus h_g^*</m> is a split injection:
          we can first project from <m>\iHom_R((P \oplus P) \otimes R, M)</m> to <m>\iHom_R((P \oplus \ZZ) \otimes R, M)</m>
          by restricting along <m>\ZZ \to \ZZ[0] \subset P</m>. The resulting composition
          <m>\iHom_R(P \otimes R, M) \to \iHom_R((P \oplus \ZZ) \otimes R, M)</m> is now the pullback along a genuine map
          <m>P \oplus \ZZ \to P</m> which is a split surjection, so the pullback is a split injection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now have an equality of maps on <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(P \oplus P, M) \cong \iHom_R((P \oplus P) \otimes R, M)</m>:
          <me>
            (\Delta_f^* \oplus \Delta_f^*) \circ (h_g^* \oplus \lambda^*) = (h_g^*\oplus \lambda^*) \circ \Delta_{fg}^*
          </me>.
          Since <m>(\Delta_f \oplus \Delta_f)^*</m> is an isomorphism and <m>h_g^* \oplus \lambda^*</m>
          is a split injection,
          tracing around the square as in <xref ref="lem-replace-bounded-with-P-solid"/> (but with the sense of arrows reversed)
          shows that <m>\Delta_{fg}^*</m> is also an isomorphism.

          The fact that <m>\Mod_{R \liquid f} \subseteq \Mod_{R \liquid f^n}</m> follows from <xref ref="lem-f-times-g-liquid"/>.
          To see that <m>\Mod_{R \liquid f^n} \subseteq \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m>,
          we algebraize the statement that a null sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> is summable against <m>f</m>
          if and only if the decimated sequences <m>(m_i, m_{i+n}, \dots)</m> for <m>i=0,\dots,n-1</m> are summable against <m>f^n</m>, in which case the original sum

          This corresponds to the fact that <m>\tilde{\Delta}_{f^n} = \Delta_{f} \circ g = g \circ \Delta_{f}</m> where

          via the identification <m>P \cong \underline{\ZZ[x]}</m> (for the <m>x</m>-adic topology on the latter)

          and so <m>\tilde{\Delta}_{f^n}^*</m> is an isomorphism on <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(P, M)</m>.
          Since  <m>\tilde{\Delta}_{f^n}^*</m> factors through <m>\Delta_f^*</m> both ways,

        In general, there is no reason to expect the core of an analytic ring to have any meaningful additive structure.
        This changes if we restrict attention to <em>solid</em> analytic rings; see <xref ref="prop-solid-integral-elements"/>.

    <title>The gaseous real numbers</title>
    <p>
      We next introduce a key example that does not factor through solidification
      (although we will not deploy it in earnest until <xref ref="sec_gaga"/>).
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-R-liquid">
      <p>
        By <xref ref="cor-liquid-top-nilpotent-unit"/>,
        the category <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid f}</m> is the same for any two choices of <m>f \in (0,1)</m>.
        We denote it also as <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-R-gaseous-ring">
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have <m>\underline{\RR} \in \Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>.
          Consequently, <m>\RR_{\liquid} := (\underline{\RR}, \Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid})</m> is an analytic ring.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>S \in \Prof</m>, we must check that <m>\Delta^*</m> acts isomorphically on
          <me>
            \Hom_{\CAb}(P \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\RR})= \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \iHom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], \underline{\RR}))
          </me>.
          Using <xref ref="eq-ihom-S-to-X"/> this becomes
          <me>
             \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\Cts(S, \RR)})
          </me>.
          Since the compact-open topology on <m>\Cts(S, \RR)</m> is induced by the supremum norm,
          we are reduced to checking that for any null sequence of functions <m>g_n\colon S \to \RR</m> for the supremum norm and any <m>f \in (0,1)</m>,
          the sequence <m>(f^n g_n)_n</m> is summable in <m>\Cts(S, \RR)</m>. This follows by observing that the supremum norms <m>c_n</m> of <m>g_n</m> form a null sequence in <m>\RR</m>
          and <m>f^n c_n</m> is summable, so <m>\sum_n f^n g_n</m> is absolutely convergent.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The same logic as in <xref ref="prop-R-gaseous-ring"/> shows that for any real Banach space <m>V</m>, <m>\underline{V} \in \Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>.
        Since we can take limits in <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>, we also obtain Frechet spaces and various other classical examples from functional analysis,
        but now with a specific tensor product that does not preserve these subcategories.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in order to work with the category <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR}\liquid}</m>,
        we really need to compute the coalescence of <m>\RR[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m>.
        Possibly the easiest way to do this is to compute the analogue in a certain universal setting;
        see <xref ref="prop-initial-analytic"/> for the analogue and <xref ref="prop-liquefaction-of-basic-over-R"/> for the result over <m>\RR</m>.

    <title>The initial analytic ring</title>
    <p>
      For some calculations, it is helpful to describe a <q>universal</q> version of coalescence.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-initial-base-ring">
      <p>
        Let <m>\ZZ[\hat{q}]</m> be a copy of <m>P := \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> viewed as an algebra over <m>\ZZ[q]</m> via <m>q^n \mapsto [n]</m>.
        Then set <m>A_0^{\triangleright} := \ZZ[\hat{q}][q^{-1}]</m>; this condensed ring is represented by the topological ring with underlying ring <m>\ZZ[q^{\pm}]</m>,
        which is initial among condensed rings <m>R</m> equipped with a choice of a topologically nilpotent unit <m>q \in R(*)^\times</m>.
        By <xref ref="prop-liquefaction"/>, the pair <m>(A_0^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{A_0^{\triangleright} \liquid q})</m> is a pre-analytic ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The ring <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m> is not itself <m>q</m>-coalescent because we cannot take any infinite sums over <m>q</m>.
      To remedy this, we allow certain controlled infinite sums.

        and set <m>A^{\triangleright} = \bigcup_k A_k^{\triangleright}</m>.
        That is, <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> consists of Laurent series whose coefficients grow polynomially in the exponent.

        <p>
          For <m>k=1,2,\dots</m> and <m>S \in \Prof</m>, a power series in <m>\ZZ((q)) \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> belongs to <m>A_k^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> if and only if
          it can be written as <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i</m> where <m>(s_i)_i</m> is a null sequence in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We treat the case <m>S = \{*\}</m> in detail, the general case being similar but with more notation.
          Given a null sequence <m>(s_i)_i</m> in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright}</m>,
          for some fixed <m>n,c</m> we have <m>s_i = \sum_{m \geq -n} s_{i,m} q^m</m> where we have
          <m>|s_{i,m}| \leq c(m+n)^{k-2}</m> for all <m>i,m</m> if <m>k \gt 1</m>,
          and for <m>k =1</m> we instead have that only finitely many of the <m>s_{i,m}</m> are nonzero.
          Now write
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \sum_{m \geq -n} s_{i,m} q^{m+i}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;= \sum_{j \geq -n} \left( \sum_{i=0}^{j+n} s_{i,j-i} \right) q^j
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          If <m>k=1</m> it is obvious that the resulting series has bounded coefficients and so belongs to <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m>. Otherwise,
          since <m>|s_{i,j-i}| \leq c(j+n-i)^k</m> for all <m>i,j</m>, we have 
          <me>
            \left| \sum_{i=0}^{j+n} s_{i,j-i} \right| \leq c(j+n+1)^{k-1} 
          </me>
          from which we infer that <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i \in A_{k}^{\triangleright}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove the converse, we employ a trick introduced in <xref ref="rem-sum-null-against-f"/>.
          Without loss of generality we may consider an element <m>t = \sum_{m=0}^\infty t_m q^m \in A_k^{\triangleright}</m>
          such that for some <m>c\gt  0</m>, we have <m>|t_m|leq c(m+1)^{k-1}</m> for all <m>n</m>. If <m>k=1</m>, we write
          <me>
            t = \sum_{m=0}^\infty (t_{2m} q^m + t_{2m+1}q^{m+1}) q^m
          </me>
          and the quantities <m>t_{2m} q^m + t_{2m+1}q^{m+1}</m> form a null sequence in <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m>.
          If <m>k \gt 1</m>, set
          <me>
            s_{i,j} := \left \lfloor \frac{t_{i+j} + j}{i+j+1} \right\rfloor,
          </me>
          so that <m>|s_{i,j}| \leq c(i+j+1)^{k-1}</m> and <m>t_m = \sum_{i=0}^m t_{i,m-i}</m>.
          Set <m>s_i := \sum_{j=0}^\infty s_{i,j} q^j</m>, so that
          <me>
            t = \sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (s_{2i} q^i + s_{2i+1}q^{i+1}) q^i
          </me>

    <title>A remark on terminology</title>
    <remark xml:id="rem-gaseous-terminology">
      <p>
        We insert a note on the metaphor underlying terminology here. We want to think of the module category of a discrete analytic ring as
        consisting of an inchoate elemental plasma, as found in the empty areas of outer space.
        By contrast, we think of the module category of a solid analytic ring as consisting of more concrete objects, such as rocky planets.
        The process of adding elements to the core of an analytic ring amounts to coalescing loose matter into something more structured;
        that is, the core is the source of <q>gravity</q> that pulls the matter together.
