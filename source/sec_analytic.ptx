  <title>Analytic rings</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we introduce the concept of an <term>analytic ring</term>, which in some sense gives the precise category of base rings over
      which one can do analytic geometry. This will correspond roughly to specifying an underlying condensed commutative ring and a category of <q>complete modules</q> over this ring.
      We have seen a few examples already coming from solid abelian groups, but using an analogue of solidification we will generate many more,
      including a key example associated to the real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: a previous version of these notes used the term <term>liquid</term>, but this created a terminological conflict
      with <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-notes"/>,
      in which <q>liquid</q> refers to a class of analytic rings that is not covered in these notes
      (see <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-analytic"/>, or for a brief taste <xref ref="bib-liquid"/>).
      To resolve this, we are now using the term <term>coalescent</term>. See
      <xref ref="rem-gaseous-terminology"/> for some discussion of the metaphors underlying the terminology.

    <title>Analytic rings</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        By a <term>condensed (commutative) ring</term>, we will mean a commutative ring object in the symmetric monoidal category <m>\CAb</m>.
        Similarly, for <m>R</m> a condensed commutative ring (meaning a commutative ring object in <m>\CAb</m>),
        by a <term>condensed <m>R</m>-module</term> we will mean an <m>R</m>-module object in <m>\CAb</m>
        Write <m>\Mod_R</m> for the category of condensed <m>R</m>-modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        This notation must be used carefully to avoid creating confusion.
        For instance, for <m>R</m> a discrete commutative ring,
        there is a natural full embedding <m>\Mod_R \to \Mod_{\underline{R}}</m>
        which is not an equivalence: its essential image consists solely of the discrete <m>R</m>-modules.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      To define an analytic ring, we specify a base ring and a category of <q>complete</q> modules over this base ring.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-analytic-ring">
      <p>
        A <term>pre-analytic ring</term> is a pair <m>R = (R^{\triangleright}, \Mod_R)</m> where <m>R^\triangleright</m> 
        is a condensed commutative ring and <m>\Mod_R</m> is a full subcategory of <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m>
        closed under limits, colimits, and extensions, and satisfying
        <m>\iExt^i_{R^\triangleright}(M, N) \in \Mod_R</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>
        whenever <m>M \in \Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}, N \in \Mod_R</m>.
        A morphism of pre-analytic rings <m>R \to S</m> is a morphism <m>R^{\triangleright} \to S^{\triangleright}</m> of condensed commutative rings
        such that for any <m>M \in \Mod_S</m>, the pullback of <m>M</m> from <m>\Mod_{S^{\triangleright}}</m> to <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> belongs to <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <term>analytic ring</term> is a pre-analytic ring 
        in which in addition <m>R^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_R</m>.
        We then have a symmetric monoidal structure on <m>\Mod_R</m> with unit <m>R^{\triangleright}</m> (see <xref ref="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic"/>).
        A morphism of analytic rings is a morphism of the underlying pre-analytic rings.
        Let <m>\AnRing</m> denote the category of analytic rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all underlying objects of <m>\Mod_R</m> belong to <m>\CAb_\solid</m>, we refer to the result as a <term>solid analytic ring</term>;
        note that it is not enough to simply have <m>R^{\triangleright} \in \CAb_\solid</m> (<xref ref="rem-discrete-not-solid"/>).
        Let <m>\AnRing_\solid</m> denote the full subcategory of <m>\AnRing</m> consisting of solid analytic rings;
        we are free to describe solid analytic rings using the interpretation of <m>\CAb_\solid</m> in terms of solid abelian groups (<xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Given a pre-analytic ring, the embedding functor <m>\Mod_R \to \Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> admits a left adjoint
        which we will call <em>analytic completion</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, forming the analytic completion of <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{T}]</m> for <m>T \in \Prof</m> yields 
        an object we call <m>R[\underline{T}]</m>; these objects form a set
        of compact (but not necessarily projective) generators of the category <m>\Mod_R</m>.
        A morphism of pre-analytic rings can then be interpreted as a map <m>R^{\triangleright} \to S^{\triangleright}</m>
        such that for each <m>T \in \Prof</m>,
        the image of <m>S[\underline{T}]</m> in <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> via restriction of scalars
        belongs to <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We define a tensor product <m>\otimes</m> on <m>\Mod_R</m> by taking the tensor product in <m>\Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m>
        and then applying analytic completion to get back to <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic">
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a pre-analytic ring and let <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m> be the analytic completion of <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>.
        Since <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} R^{\triangleright}</m> and <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>
        have the same analytic completion, 
        the multiplication map <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} R^{\triangleright} \to R^{\triangleright}</m>
        induces a map <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \to \hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>.
        That is, <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m> canonically promotes to an <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>-algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, for <m>M \in \Mod_R</m>, we have <m>M = R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m>;
        since <m>R^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m> and <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m>
        have the same analytic completion, we also have <m>M = \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M</m>.
        Consequently, the <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>-module structure on <m>M</m> canonically promotes to an <m>\hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m>-module structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in this vein, for <m>M \in \Mod_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}, N \in \Mod_R</m> we have 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \Hom_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \hat{\otimes}_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp;= \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright} \otimes_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} M,N)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; = \Hom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
          </mrow>
        </md>.
        (The introduction of <m>\hat{\otimes}_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> in place of <m>\otimes_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> is where we are using the fact that
        the target <m>N</m> belongs to <m>\Mod_R</m>.)
        Since this applies to <m>M \in \Mod_R</m> in particular,
        it confirms that <m>\Mod_R \to \Mod_{R^{\triangleright}}</m> factors through <m>\Mod_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the same logic with <m>M</m> replaced by <m>M \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> for <m>S \in \Prof</m>,
        we see that also <m>\iHom_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) \cong \iHom_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)</m>.
        However, note that it is not automatic that
        <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-compare-extensions-after-analytic-completion">
          \iExt^i_{R^{\triangleright}}(M,N) \cong \iExt^i_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}}(M,N)
        </md>
        for <m>i \gt 0</m> (or even the corresponding statement at the level of global sections).
        When this holds, <m>\hat{R} := (\hat{R}^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{\hat{R}} := \Mod_R)</m> is an analytic ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        The condition <xref ref="eq-compare-extensions-after-analytic-completion"/> for all <m>i \geq 0</m> and all <m>M,N \in \Mod_R</m>
        formally reduces to the case <m>M = \hat{R}^{\triangleright}</m> (by writing <m>M</m> as a suitable colimit).
        It can also be interpreted as saying that
        <m>\hat{R}^\triangleright</m> is also the <em>derived</em> analytic completion of <m>R^{\triangleright}</m>,
        or that 
        <md>
          \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \hat{\otimes}^L_{R^{\triangleright}} \hat{R}^{\triangleright} = \hat{R}^{\triangleright}
        </md>.
        This condition will automatically satisfied in the examples we consider; see <xref ref="rem-liquefaction-kills-ext1"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Building on <xref ref="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic"/>, we verify <xref ref="eq-compare-extensions-after-analytic-completion"/> 
        for <m>M = \hat{R}^{\triangleright}, i=1</m>; in this case the claim is that <m>\iExt^1_{R^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright},N) = 0</m>. 
        For any exact sequence in <m>\Mod_{R}</m> of the form
        <md>
          0 \to N \to N' \to \hat{R}^{\triangleright} \to 0
        </md>
        we have <m>N' \in \Mod_{R}</m>. The pullback sequence
        <md>
          0 \to N \to N' \times_{\hat{R}^{\triangleright}} R^{\triangleright} \to R^{\triangleright} \to 0
        </md>
        (where the term in the middle is the fiber product, not the tensor product!)
        is split because <m>R^{\triangleright}</m> is projective as a module over itself;
        any splitting then extends by adjunction to a splitting of the original sequence.
        This proves that <m>\Ext^1_{R^{\triangleright}}(\hat{R}^{\triangleright},N) = 0</m>; we deduce the claimed statement by 
        replacing <m>N</m> with <m>\iHom_{R^{\triangleright}}(R^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}], N)</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The notation <m>R = (R^{\triangleright}, \Mod_R)</m> is meant to simulate the notation used by Huber in his development of the theory of <term>adic spaces</term>.
        We will integrate this theory into our work later, by showing that Huber pairs can be viewed as a full subcategory of solid analytic rings (<xref ref="prop-Huber-pair-to-solid-analytic"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-filtered-colimit-analytic">
      <p>
        To take a colimit of a system of analytic rings <m>(R_i^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{R_i})</m>, 
        one first takes the colimit in pre-analytic rings:
        the base ring is <m>\colim_i R_i^{\triangleright}</m> and the module category is the limit of <m>\Mod_{R_i}</m>.
        One then replaces the base ring with its analytic completion as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <em>filtered</em> colimits, the second step is not necessary: if <m>i \leq j</m> then <m>R_j^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_{R_i}</m>,
        so the colimit automatically belongs to <m>\Mod_{R_i}</m> for every <m>i</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-more-homotopical-rings">
      <p>
        For some applications, it is useful to extend the notion of an analytic ring to the case where the base is no longer a condensed commutative ring,
        but a more homotopical object such as an <term>animated ring</term>, a <term>simplicial ring</term>, or an <term><m>E_\infty</m>-commutative ring</term>.
        We will not touch on these topics in these notes.

    <title>Examples of analytic rings</title>
    <example xml:id="exa-discrete-analytic-ring">
      <p>
        For every commutative ring <m>A</m>, the pair <m>(\underline{A}, \Mod_{\underline{A}})</m> is an analytic ring.
        An analytic ring of this form will be said to be <term>discrete</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, if <m>A</m> is a condensed commutative ring, we may treat <m>(A, \Mod_A)</m> as an analytic ring.
        It is natural to label this also as <m>A</m>, so that the two resulting interpretations of <m>\Mod_A</m> coincide.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-discrete-not-solid">
      <p>
        Beware that while discrete abelian groups are solid, discrete analytic rings are not solid analytic rings
        because the module category includes non-solid objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that for <m>A</m> a commutative ring, the pair <m>(\underline{A}, \Mod_A)</m> (i.e., taking the discrete modules) is not an analytic ring: 
        it fails to satisfy closure under countable limits, e.g., because <m>\prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m> is not a discrete <m>\ZZ</m>-module.
        It also fails the condition that <m>\iHom_{\underline{A}}(M, N) \in \Mod_A</m> for <m>M \in \Mod_{\underline{A}}, N \in \Mod_A</m>
        for related reasons; for example, for <m>R = \ZZ, M = \bigoplus_\NN \underline{\ZZ}, N = \underline{\ZZ}</m>,
        we have <m>\iHom_{\underline{\ZZ}}(M, N) = \prod_\NN \underline{\ZZ}</m>.
        This is corrected for using solid modules instead (<xref ref="exa-solid-analytic-ring"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-solid-analytic-ring">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a condensed commutative ring,
        define the category of <term>solid <m>R</m>-modules</term> by
        <md>
          \Mod_{R\solid} := \Mod_R(\CAb_\solid) = \Mod_R \times_{\CAb} \CAb_\solid
        </md>.
        By <xref ref="prop-solid-category"/>, <m>(R, \Mod_{R \solid})</m> is a pre-analytic ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>R</m> is itself solid as a condensed abelian group, then <m>(R, \Mod_{R \solid})</m> is an analytic ring.
        By <xref ref="lem-delta-pullback-on-Rhom"/>, this applies if <m>R</m> is discrete;
        comparing with <xref ref="exa-discrete-analytic-ring"/> gives us examples of analytic rings where the underlying ring is the same but the module category is different.

    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative ring and <m>f \in R</m> not a zero-divisor, 
        let <m>\hat{R}_{\solid}</m> denote the classical <m>f</m>-completion of <m>R</m> in <m>\Ab_\solid</m>
        (i.e., the usual <m>f</m>-adic completion carrying the <m>f</m>-adic topology). 
        The pair consisting of <m>\hat{R}_\solid</m> and the category of derived <m>f</m>-complete objects in <m>\Mod_{R \solid}</m> is a solid analytic ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the pair consisting of <m>\hat{R}_\solid[1/f]</m> and the category of derived <m>f</m>-complete objects
        in <m>\Mod_{R \solid}</m> on which <m>f</m> is invertible is a solid analytic ring.

  <subsection>
    <title>Coalescence</title>
    <p>
      We define a new process for constructing pre-analytic rings.
      We start with a bit of motivation.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> a commutative topological ring, <m>f \in R</m> an element, <m>M</m> a Hausdorff topological <m>R</m>-module, and <m>(a_n)</m> a sequence in <m>M</m>,
        we say that <m>(a_n)</m> is <term>summable against <m>f</m></term> if the series <m>\sum_n a_n f^n</m> converges in <m>M</m>.
        In this language, <m>M</m> is classically <m>f</m>-complete if and only every series is summable against <m>f</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, <m>M</m> is solid if and only if every null sequence is summable against <m>f=1</m>.
        This suggests that we might find it productive to also enforce summability of null sequences against other <m>f</m>.
        For example, in <m>\RR</m> every null sequence is summable against any <m>f</m> with <m>|f| \lt 1</m>, but not in general against <m>f=1</m>.

      We now turn to a formal definition.

        Picking up a thread from <xref ref="rem-exact-seq-for-P"/>,
        we compare the split exact sequence
        <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-split-sequence-P-mod-Z">
          0 \to R \to P \otimes R \to (P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R \to 0

          0 \to P \otimes R \stackrel{\Delta_f}{\to} (P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R \to \coker(\Delta_f)/R \to 0
        </md>.
        The latter gives an internally projective resolution of <m>\coker(\Delta_f)/R</m> of length <m>1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us see what taking internal Homs into <m>M \in \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m> does to these sequences.
        For <xref ref="eq-split-sequence-P-mod-Z"/>, since the sequence is split we get for every <m>i \geq 0</m> an exact sequence
        <md>
          0 \to \iExt^i_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R(P \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R(R, M) \to 0
        </md>;
        that is, the map <m>\iHom_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M) \to \iHom_R(P \otimes R, M)</m> is injective with cokernel <m>M</m>
        and the map <m>\iExt^i_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R(P \otimes R, M)</m> is an isomorphism for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <xref ref="eq-resolve-coker-Deltaf-liquefaction"/>, <m>\Delta_f^*\colon \iExt^i_R(P \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R(P \otimes R, M)</m>
        is an isomorphism for all <m>i \geq 0</m>, so <m>\iExt^i_R(\coker(\Delta_f), M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
        In other words, the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>\coker(\Delta_f)</m> is zero in all degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <xref ref="eq-resolve-coker-mod-R-liquefaction"/>, we 
        refactor <m>\Delta_f^*\colon \iExt^i_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R(P \otimes R, M)</m>
        as the isomorphism <m>\iExt^i_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M)</m>
        followed by the pullback <m>\iExt^i_R((P/\underline{\ZZ}) \otimes R, M) \to \iExt^i_R(P \otimes R, M)</m> arising from <xref ref="eq-split-sequence-P-mod-Z"/>.
        We deduce that <m>\iExt^1_R(\coker(\Delta_f)/R, M) = M</m> and <m>\iExt^i_R(\coker(\Delta_f)/R, M) = 0</m> for <m>i \neq 1</m>;
        in particular, the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>\coker(\Delta_f)/R</m> is concentrated in degree <m>-1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, using the exact sequence
        <md>
          0 \to R \to \coker(\Delta_f) \to \coker(\Delta_f)/R \to 0 
        </md>
        we deduce that the derived <m>f</m>-coalescence of <m>R</m> is concentrated in degree <m>0</m>.
        We are thus in the favorable situation of <xref ref="rem-pre-analytic-to-analytic"/>, that is,
        <m>(R_{\liquid f}, \Mod_{R \liquid f})</m> is an analytic ring.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The operation of <m>f</m>-coalescence bears a strong formal resemblance to derived <m>f</m>-completion.
      This drives the next few remarks.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-analytify-element-which-ring">
      <p>
        If <m>S \to R</m> is a homomorphism of commutative ring objects in <m>\CAb</m>, then for any <m>f \in S</m>

        <md>
          \Mod_{R \liquid f} = \Mod_{S \liquid f} \times_{\Mod_S} \Mod_R

        This applies in particular when <m>f = 1</m>, in which case we may take <m>S = \ZZ</m> to obtain
        <md>
          \Mod_{R \liquid 1} = \Mod_{R\solid}
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that for <m>M \in \Mod_R</m>, forming the <m>f</m>-coalescence <m>M_{\liquid f}</m> commutes with restriction of scalars from <m>S</m> to <m>R</m>,
        so there is no ambiguity in the notation. However, this is not necessarily true of the <em>derived</em> <m>f</m>-coalescence unless <m>S</m> is projective in <m>\Mod_R</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For <m>f,g \in R</m>, (derived) <m>f</m>-coalescence commutes with (derived) <m>g</m>-coalescence because the composition in either order can be written
        in a symmetric form using the Koszul complex associated to <m>\Delta_f</m> and <m>\Delta_g</m>. 
        In particular, (derived) <m>f</m>-coalescence acts on the (derived) category of <m>g</m>-coalescent modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, for any subset <m>S \subset R</m>, taking <m>R</m> together with the full subcategory 
        <m>\Mod_{R \liquid S} := \bigcap_{f \in S} \Mod_{R \liquid f}</m> forms a pre-analytic ring.
        An important special case is when <m>1 \in S</m>; thanks to <xref ref="prop-solid-vs-presumptively-solid"/>,
        we can treat this case in the language of solid abelian groups.

      We study the effect of coalescing with respect to different elements.
      This involves picking up the thread from <xref ref="rem-infinite-series"/>, now
      algebraizing various statements about summability of null sequences against <m>f</m>.
      We will upgrade this discussion in <xref ref="subsec-core-of-an-analytic-ring"/>.

          We algebraize the statement that a null sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> is summable against <m>f</m>
          if and only if the decimated sequences <m>(m_i, m_{i+n}, \dots)</m> for <m>i=0,\dots,n-1</m> are summable against <m>f^n</m>, in which case the original sum

          via the identification <m>P \cong \underline{\ZZ[x]}</m> (for a certain topology on the latter, as in <xref ref="def-internally-projective-object"/>)
          this corresponds to the factorization

          and so <m>\tilde{\Delta}_{f^n}^*</m> is an isomorphism on <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(P, M)</m>.
          Since  <m>\tilde{\Delta}_{f^n}^*</m> factors through <m>\Delta_f^*</m> both ways,

          Let <m>R</m> be a condensed ring and choose <m>f,g \in R(*)</m>.
          Suppose that there exists an <m>R</m>-algebra morphism <m>h_g \colon P \otimes R \to P \otimes R</m> taking <m>[n]</m> to <m>g^n [n]</m>.
          (For example, this holds when <m>R</m> is a topological ring and <m>g</m> is topologically nilpotent.)
          Then <m>\Mod_{R \liquid f} \subseteq \Mod_{R \liquid fg}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We would like to algebraize the following logic.
          Given a null sequence <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m>,
          if we can rescale by powers of <m>g</m> to get another null sequence
          <m>(m_0, g m_1, g^2 m_2, \dots)</m>, 
          and we know that every null sequence is summable against <m>f</m>,
          we may conclude that the original sequence is summable against <m>fg</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next encounter a subtlety in the argument that can already be seen in terms of null sequences. 
          The strategy is to invert the function
          <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-difference-by-fg">
            (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto (m_0 - fg m_1, m_1 - fg m_2, \dots),
          </md>
          which symbolically is achieved by 
          <md>
            (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto \left( \sum_{n=0}^\infty (fg)^n m_n, \sum_{n=0}^\infty (fg)^n m_{n+1}, \dots \right) 
          </md>;
          however, composing the map
          <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-rescale-by-g">
            (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto (m_0, g m_1, g^2 m_2, \dots)
          </md>
          with the map
          <md>
            (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty f^n m_n, \sum_{n=0}^\infty f^n m_{n+1}, \dots \right)
          </md>
          gives 
          <md>
            (m_0, m_1, \dots) \mapsto \left( \sum_{n=0}^\infty (fg)^n m_n, g \sum_{n=0}^\infty (fg)^n m_{n+1}, g^2 \sum_{n=0}^\infty (fg)^n m_{n+2}, \dots \right)
          </md>
          where the term in position <m>n</m> is the term we want but multiplied by <m>g^n</m>.
          In other words, we cannot perform the operation <xref ref="eq-difference-by-fg"/> by first rescaling by <m>g</m> as in <xref ref="eq-rescale-by-g"/>,
          then performing <m>(m_0,m_1,\dots) \mapsto (m_0-fm_1, m_1-fm_2)</m>; rather, this executes <xref ref="eq-difference-by-fg"/> plus rescaling by <m>g</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We may resolve this by working in terms of two-dimensional arrays.
          To wit, to execute <xref ref="eq-difference-by-fg"/>, we first expand <m>(m_0, m_1, \dots)</m> into a two-dimensional array
          and rescale <em>columns</em> by powers of <m>g</m> to get
          <md>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              m_0 \amp gm_1 \amp g^2m_2 \amp  \\
              m_1 \amp gm_2 \amp g^2m_3 \amp \cdots \\
              m_2 \amp gm_3 \amp g^2m_4 \amp  \\
              \amp \vdots \amp \amp \ddots 
            \end{pmatrix}
          </md>;
          difference <em>rows</em> by <m>f</m> to get 
          <md>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              m_0-fgm_1 \amp gm_1-fg^2m_2 \amp g^2m_2-fg^3m_3 \amp  \\
              m_1-fgm_2 \amp gm_2-fg^2m_3 \amp g^2m_3-fg^2m-4 \amp \cdots \\
              m_2-fgm_3 \amp gm_3-fg^2m_4 \amp g^2m_4-fg^2m_5 \amp  \\
              \amp \vdots \amp \amp \ddots 
            \end{pmatrix}
          </md>;
          and finally project onto the first column, noting that this operation is a section of the first one.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now translate these steps into operations on condensed modules, and ultimately on condensed rings.
          The expansion into a two-dimensional array should give a map <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, R) \to \Hom_{\CAb}(P \otimes P, R)</m>;
          this is pullback by the map <m>+_P\colon P \otimes P \to P</m> induced by the addition map <m>\NN_\infty \times \NN_\infty \to \NN_\infty</m>.
          The rescaling by <m>g</m> is pullback by the given <m>R</m>-algebra map <m>h_g\colon P \otimes R \to P \otimes R</m>,
          or more precisely by <m>\id \otimes h_g</m> to indicate that we are rescaling the columns. 
          Differencing the rows is pullback by <m>\id \otimes \Delta_f</m>.
          Finally, projecting onto the first column is pullback by the first injection <m>\iota_1 \colon P = P \otimes \ZZ \to P \otimes P</m>.
          Undoing the pullbacks (which reverses the order of composition), we end up with a putative equality
          <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-break-down-fg-pullback">
            \Delta_{fg} = +_P \circ (\id \otimes (h_g \circ \Delta_f)) \circ \iota_1
          </md>
          of morphisms <m>P \to P \otimes R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, we still need to verify <xref ref="eq-break-down-fg-pullback"/>: we can directly verify that both sides act by
          <m>[n] \mapsto [n] - fg[n+1]</m>,
          but this is only sufficient when <m>R</m> is a topological ring. Fortunately, we may check the equality in the universal case where
          <m>R = P[T]</m>, <m>f = T</m>, and <m>g = [1]</m>, where an argument by elements suffices, and then specialize to the case at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we transpose <xref ref="eq-break-down-fg-pullback"/> to get
          <md>
            \Delta_{fg}^* = \iota_1^* \circ (\id \otimes (\Delta_f^* \circ h_g^*)) \circ +_P^*
          </md>.
          Given that <m>\Delta_f^*</m> is invertible on <m>\Hom_{\CAb}(P, M)</m>, and using the fact that 
          the maps <m>\iota_1^*</m> and <m>(\id \otimes h_g^*) \circ +_P^*</m> split each other, we obtain
          <md>
            (\Delta_{fg}^*)^{-1} = \iota_1^* \circ (\id \otimes (\Delta_f^*)^{-1} \circ h_g^*)) \circ +_P^*
          </md>,
          which proves the claim.

          \Mod_{R \liquid f} \subseteq \Mod_{R \liquid f(g^n f^{-1})} = \Mod_{R \liquid g^n} \subseteq \Mod_{R \liquid g}

        That is, the subcategory <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid f}</m> of <m>\Mod_R</m> is independent of <m>f</m>;
        we thus denote it also as <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>S \in \Prof</m>, <m>f \in (0,1)</m>, we must check that <m>\Delta_f^*</m> acts isomorphically on

             \Hom_{\CAb}(P, \underline{\Cts(S, \RR)})

          Since the compact-open topology on <m>\Cts(S, \RR)</m> is induced by the supremum norm,
          we are reduced to checking that for any null sequence of functions <m>g_n\colon S \to \RR</m> for the supremum norm,
          the sequence <m>(f^n g_n)_n</m> is summable in <m>\Cts(S, \RR)</m>. This follows by observing that the supremum norms <m>c_n</m> of <m>g_n</m> form a null sequence in <m>\RR</m>

    <remark>

        The same logic as in <xref ref="prop-R-gaseous-ring"/> shows that for any real Banach space <m>V</m>, <m>\underline{V} \in \Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>.
        Since we can take limits in <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR} \liquid}</m>, we also obtain Frechet spaces and various other classical examples from functional analysis,

        However, in order to work with the category <m>\Mod_{\underline{\RR}\liquid}</m>,

    <p>
      For some calculations, it is helpful to describe a <q>universal</q> version of coalescence
      with respect to a topologically nilpotent element.
    </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m> be a copy of <m>P := \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> viewed as an algebra over <m>\ZZ[q]</m> via <m>q^n \mapsto [n]</m>.
        This condensed ring is represented by the topological ring with underlying ring <m>\ZZ[q]</m>,
        which is initial among condensed rings <m>R</m> equipped with a choice of an element <m>q \in R(*)</m>
        and a morphism of condensed commutative rings <m>P \to R</m> taking <m>[1]</m> to <m>q</m>
        (which witnesses that <m>q</m> is topologically nilpotent).
        By <xref ref="prop-liquefaction"/>, the pair <m>(A_0^{\triangleright}, \Mod_{A_0^{\triangleright} \liquid q})</m> is a pre-analytic ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The ring <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m> is not itself <m>q</m>-coalescent because we cannot take any infinite sums over <m>q</m>.
      To remedy this, we allow certain controlled infinite sums.

      <p>
        For <m>k=1,2,\dots</m>, define the topological ring

          A_k^{\triangleright} := \bigcup_{c \gt 0} \prod_{m=0}^\infty \left(\ZZ \cap [-c(m+1)^{k-1}, c(m+1)^{k-1}] \right) q^m

        and set <m>A^{\triangleright} = \bigcup_k A_k^{\triangleright}</m>.
        That is, <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> consists of Laurent series whose coefficients grow polynomially in the exponent.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-filtration-on-universal-liquefaction1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>S \in \Prof</m> and <m>k \geq 2</m>,
          any null sequence <m>(s_i)_i</m> in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m>
          is summable against <m>q</m> in <m>A_{k}^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We treat the case <m>S = \{*\}</m> in detail, the general case being similar but with more notation.
          Given a null sequence <m>(s_i)_i</m> in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright}</m> with <m>k \geq 2</m>,
          for some fixed <m>c</m> we have <m>s_i = \sum_{m=0}^\infty s_{i,m} q^m</m> where
          <m>|s_{i,m}| \leq c(m+1)^{k-2}</m> for all <m>i,m</m>.
          Now write
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^\infty s_{i,m} q^{m+i}

            <mrow>
              &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \sum_{i=0}^{j} s_{i,j-i} \right) q^j
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Since <m>|s_{i,j-i}| \leq c(j-i+1)^{k-2}</m> for all <m>i,j</m>, we have 
          <md>
            \left| \sum_{i=0}^{j} s_{i,j-i} \right| \leq c \sum_{i=0}^j (j-i+1)^{k-2} \leq c(j+1)^{k-1} 
          </md>
          from which we infer that <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i \in A_{k}^{\triangleright}</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-filtration-on-universal-liquefaction2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>S \in \Prof</m> and <m>k \geq 1</m>,
          if a power series in <m>\ZZ\llbracket q \rrbracket \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m> belongs to <m>A_k^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m>,
          then it can be written as <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i</m> where <m>(s_i)_i</m> is a null sequence in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright} \otimes \ZZ[\underline{S}]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We again treat the case <m>S = \{*\}</m> in detail, the general case being similar but with more notation.
          For this, we employ a trick introduced in <xref ref="rem-sum-null-against-f"/>.
          By hypothesis, we start with an element <m>t = \sum_{m=0}^\infty t_m q^m \in A_k^{\triangleright}</m>
          such that for some <m>c\gt  0</m>, we have <m>|t_m| \leq c(m+1)^{k-1}</m> for all <m>m</m>. If <m>k=1</m>, we write
          <md>
            t = \sum_{m=0}^\infty (t_{2m} q^m + t_{2m+1}q^{m+1}) q^m
          </md>
          and then observe that the quantities <m>t_{2m} q^m + t_{2m+1}q^{m+1}</m> form a null sequence in <m>A_0^{\triangleright}</m>.
          If <m>k \gt 1</m>, set
          <md>
            s_{i,j} := \left \lfloor \frac{t_{i+j} + j}{i+j+1} \right\rfloor
          </md>,
          so that <m>|s_{i,j}| \leq c(i+j+1)^{k-2} +1  \leq (c+1)(i+j+1)^{k-2}</m> and <m>t_m = \sum_{i=0}^m s_{i,m-i}</m>.
          Set <m>s_i := \sum_{j=0}^\infty s_{i,j} q^j</m>, so that
          <md>
            t = \sum_{i=0}^\infty s_i q^i = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (s_{2i} q^i + s_{2i+1}q^{i+1}) q^i
          </md>.
          It now suffices to check that as <m>i</m> varies,
          the quantities <m>s_{2i} q^i + s_{2i+1}q^{i+1}</m> form a null sequence in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright}</m>:
          write
          <md>
            s_{2i+*} q^{i+*} = \sum_{j=i+*}^\infty s_{2i+*,j-i-*} q^j
          </md>
          and then note that because <m>j \geq i</m>,
          <md>
            <mrow>
              |s_{2i+*,j-i-*}| &amp;\leq (c+1)(i+j+1)^{k-2}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;\leq (c+1) (2j+1)^{k-2} \leq 2^{k-2} (c+1) (j+1)^{k-2}
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          The point is that this expression includes a constant <m>2^{k-2} (c+1)</m> that is independent of <m>i</m>,
          so our sequence <m>s_{2i} q^i + s_{2i+1}q^{i+1}</m> is both <m>q</m>-adically null and
          is constrained to a fixed term in the union over <m>c</m> in <xref ref="eq-universal-liquefaction-filtered"/>;
          this makes it a null sequence in <m>A_{k-1}^{\triangleright}</m>.

          We have <m>A^{\triangleright} \in \Mod_{A_0^{\triangleright} \liquid q}</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>S = \varprojlim_i S_i \in \Prof</m>, we may apply 
          <xref ref="lem-filtration-on-universal-liquefaction1"/> and <xref ref="lem-filtration-on-universal-liquefaction2"/> to see that the action of <m>\Delta_q^*</m> on

          </md>
          is an isomorphism. This implies that the action on <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(P, A^{\triangleright})</m> is an isomorphism,
          and hence the desired result.

          Consequently, we have <m>\iHom_{A_0^{\triangleright}}(A^{\triangleright}, M) \cong \iHom_{A_0^{\triangleright}}(A_0^{\triangleright}, M)</m>.

          By replacing <m>M</m> with <m>\iHom_{\CAb}(\ZZ[\underline{S}], M)</m> and applying Hom-tensor adjunction, we reduce to the case <m>S = \{*\}</m>. 
          From <xref ref="lem-filtration-on-universal-liquefaction1"/> and <xref ref="lem-filtration-on-universal-liquefaction2"/>, we see that for <m>k \geq 0</m>,

          </md>.
          In particular, for <m>k \geq 0</m>,

          This follows by combining <xref ref="lem-f-times-g-liquid"/>, <xref ref="lem-f-solidification-versus-fn"/>,
          and <xref ref="rem-f-solidification-versus-fg"/>.

        For <m>R</m> a topological ring, we can extend <xref ref="lem-from-f-liquid-to-fg-liquid"/> to the case where <m>g</m> is universally power-bounded.
        However, it is not clear how to extend this conclusion to condensed rings; there is no obvious construction of a <q>universal</q>
        example of a universally power-bounded element of a condensed ring.

        In general, there is no reason to expect the core of an analytic ring to have any meaningful additive structure.
        This changes if we restrict attention to <em>solid</em> analytic rings; see <xref ref="prop-solid-integral-elements"/>.

    <title>A remark on terminology</title>
    <remark xml:id="rem-gaseous-terminology">
      <p>
        We insert a note on the metaphor underlying terminology here. We want to think of the module category of a discrete analytic ring as
        consisting of an inchoate elemental plasma, as found in the empty areas of outer space.
        By contrast, we think of the module category of a solid analytic ring as consisting of more concrete objects, such as rocky planets.
        The process of adding elements to the core of an analytic ring amounts to coalescing loose matter into something more structured;
        that is, the core is the source of <q>gravity</q> that pulls the matter together.
