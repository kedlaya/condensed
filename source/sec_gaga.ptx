  <title>Glueing and GAGA for <m>\PP^1</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we study the GAGA phenomenon for analytic rings,
      focusing on the case of <m>\PP^1</m> where we can state all the results in language that we (mostly) already have.
      We will return to the general case once we have the language of analytic stacks available to formulate the results more easily.

    <p>
      We recall some ways in which schemes interact with other geometric objects.
      This is a behavior we wish to maintain in the category of algebraic stacks.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In the category <m>\LRS</m> of locally ringed spaces, the affine scheme <m>\Spec R</m> corresponding to <m>R \in \Ring</m> has the following universal property:
        for every <m>X \in \LRS</m>, homomorphisms <m>R \to \Gamma(X, \calO_X)</m> correspond to morphisms <m>X \to \Spec R</m> via taking global sections.
        In other words, <m>\Spec</m> is right adjoint to the global sections functor <m>\LRS \to \Ring^{\op}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course we can also construct other interesting objects in <m>\LRS</m>: topological manifolds, smooth (<m>C^{\infty}</m>) manifolds, real analytic manifolds,
        complex analytic manifolds, complex analytic varieties, adic spaces, etc.
        We can carry this further by replacing <m>\LRS</m> with our new category <m>\LCRS</m> of locally condensed ringed spaces.
        In that category we have the solid adic spaces introduced in <xref ref="sec_huber_local"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the adjunction property of <m>\Spec</m> tells us exactly how these other objects map to affine schemes, it does not explain how they map to more general schemes.
        In fact this is quite an interesting matter!
      </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>X</m> a scheme locally of finite type over <m>\CC</m>, an <term>analytification</term> of <m>X</m> is a complex analytic variety <m>X^{\an}</m>
        equipped with a morphism <m>X^{\an} \to X</m> of locally ringed spaces, satisfying the following universal property:
        for any complex analytic variety <m>Y</m>, any morphism <m>Y \to X</m> of locally ringed spaces factors uniquely through <m>X^{\an}</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every scheme locally of finite type <m>X</m> over <m>\CC</m> admits an analytification <m>X^{\an}</m>.
          Moreover, the image of <m>X^{\an} \to X</m> consists of precisely the closed points of <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>X = \Spec \CC[T_1,\dots,T_n]</m>, the variety <m>X^{\an} = \CC^n</m> and the mapping <m>X^{\an} \to X</m> corresponding to the identification of <m>T_1,\dots,T_n</m>
          with the coordinate functions on <m>\CC^n</m> does the trick.
          We may then formally extend the conclusion to any closed subscheme of <m>X</m>, and then to any scheme locally of finite type over <m>\CC</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-gaga-classical">
      <title>GAGA</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>X</m> a proper scheme over <m>\CC</m>, pullback along <m>X^{\an} \to X</m> induces an exact equivalence of categories between coherent sheaves on <m>X</m> and <m>X^{\an}</m>,
          which moreover preserves sheaf cohomology.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We will recover this statement later (<xref ref="thm-gaga-classical-v2"/>).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One can similarly study analytification, and prove a GAGA theorem, for schemes over a nonarchimedean field <m>K</m> using any of rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, or adic spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of analytic stacks, we will upgrade <xref ref="thm-gaga-classical"/> to a comparison of quasicoherent sheaves. This will amount to the statement that
        <m>\PP^1_\CC</m> and its analytification become <em>isomorphic</em> when viewed as analytic stacks.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In nonarchimedean geometry, one can build the analytic analogue of <m>\PP^1</m> by glueing together two closed unit discs along their boundary.
        This works less well in complex geometry, but already in <m>p</m>-adic geometry there is a reason why one might want to change course.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reason comes from de Rham cohomology: the cokernel of the derivation <m>\frac{d}{dT}</m> on the ring <m>\QQ_p \langle T \rangle</m>
        is infinite-dimensional! For example, <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty p^n T^{p^n}</m> represents a nonzero element of the cokernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, if one replaces the Tate algebra <m>\QQ_p \langle T \rangle</m> with the <term>dagger algebra</term> <m>\QQ_p \langle T \rangle^\dagger</m>,
        meaning the subring consisting of those power series which converge on some disc of radius greater than 1 (depending on the particular series),
        then the cokernel of <m>\frac{d}{dT}</m> becomes zero!
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course one can achieve the same effect simply by working with open discs instead of closed discs.
        The contrast between these approaches amounts to the distinction between <term>dagger spaces</term> and <term>Berkovich spaces</term>.

      Quasicoherent sheaves on solid <m>\PP^1</m>
    </title>
    <p>
      We look more closely at the solid analytification of <m>\PP^1</m>, where we can build on our previous analysis.
      (One can treat <m>\PP^n</m> using similar techniques but slightly more notation.)
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For any analytic ring <m>A</m>, define the object <m>\PP^1_A \in \LCRS</m> by glueing
        <m>\AnSpec A[T]</m> and <m>\AnSpec A[T^{-1}]</m> along <m>\AnSpec A[T^{\pm}]</m>.
        This coincides with the fiber product <m>\AnSpec A \times_{\Spec \ZZ} \PP^1_{\ZZ}</m> in <m>\LCRS</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> a solid analytic ring, define the object <m>\PP^1_{A \solid} \in \LCRS</m> by glueing
        <m>\AnSpec A\langle T \rangle</m> and <m>\AnSpec A\langle T^{-1} \rangle</m> along <m>\AnSpec A\langle T^{\pm} \rangle</m>.
        Here <m>A \langle T \rangle</m> denotes the analytic ring
        <m>(A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle, \Mod_{A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle \liquid T})</m>,
        and similarly for <m>A\langle T^{-1} \rangle</m> and <m>A\langle T^{\pm} \rangle</m>.
        Using this, we obtain a natural morphism <m>\PP^1_{A\solid} \to \PP^1_{A}</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="prop-compare-solid-P1-to-analytic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a solid analytic ring, pullback along <m>\PP^1_{A \solid} \to \PP^1_A</m> induces an equivalence of 
          stable <m>\infty</m>-categories of quasicoherent sheaves.
          Moreover, these equivalences are compatible with any combination of <q>bounded above</q>, <q>bounded below</q>, <q>compact</q>, <q>pseudocoherent</q>, <q>nuclear</q>, and <q>dualizable</q>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Pulling back the given covering of <m>\PP^1_A</m> yields idempotent coverings of the constituents of <m>\PP^1_{A \solid}</m>,
          to which we may apply <xref ref="thm-idempotent-sheaf"/>. This yields the first assertion; the second then follows formally as in 
          <xref ref="rem-subsheaves-of-qcoh"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We will interpret <xref ref="prop-compare-solid-P1-to-analytic"/> later as the statement that
        <m>\PP^1_{A \solid} \to \PP^1_A</m> is an isomorphism of analytic stacks.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      To recover more familiar forms of GAGA, we must bring in the scheme <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> which receives a canonical map from <m>\PP^1_A</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-gaga-solid">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a solid analytic ring, pullback along <m>\PP^1_{A} \to \PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> induces equivalences of categories (or stable <m>\infty</m>-categories) as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              pseudocoherent complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> to discrete pseudocoherent complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>;
            </li>
            <li>
              perfect complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> to discrete perfect complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>;
            </li>
            <li>
              vector bundles on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> to vector bundles on <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          In addition, if <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> is noetherian, we get an equivalence between coherent sheaves on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> 
          and <m>\PP^1_A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm-pseudocoherent-descent"/>,
          pullback of pseudocoherent complexes from <m>\Spec A[T]</m> to <m>\AnSpec A[T]</m>,
          from <m>\Spec A[T^{-1}]</m> to <m>\AnSpec A[T^{-1}]</m>, and from <m>\Spec A[T^{\pm}]</m> to <m>\AnSpec A[T^{\pm}]</m>
          yields equivalences of categories. Glueing these statements yields the first assertion. We deduce the assertions about perfect complexes and vector bundles similarly 
          by applying <xref ref="thm-pseudocoherent-descent-with-amplitude"/>, <xref ref="cor-perfect-complexes"/>, and <xref ref="cor-vector-bundles"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case where <m>A</m> is noetherian, coherent sheaves on <m>\PP^1_A</m> can be identified with pseudocoherent complexes concentrated in 
          amplitudes <m>(-\infty, 0]</m> with vanishing cohomology in degrees <m>\lt 0</m>. We may thus reduce to the previous paragraph.

        <p>
          The point is that every quasicoherent sheaf on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> is ind-coherent.

    <p>
      We can now recover the <q>standard</q> formulation of GAGA over a nonarchimedean field.

    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>K</m> be a nonarchimedean field.
        For <m>X</m> a scheme locally of finite type over <m>K</m>, an <term>analytification</term> of <m>X</m> is an adic space <m>X^{\an}</m>

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Again, it suffices to check that for the affine space <m>X = \Spec K[T_1,\dots,T_n]</m>,
          the ascending union of all closed polydiscs serves as an analytification; 
          we may then formally extend the conclusion to any closed subscheme of <m>X</m>, and then to any scheme locally of finite type over <m>\CC</m>.

        <p>
          For <m>X = \PP^1_K \times_K \cdots \times_K \PP^1_K</m>, this follows from <xref ref="prop-compare-solid-P1-to-analytic"/> and <xref ref="thm-gaga-solid"/>
          modulo one point: we need to know that the local rings of <m>X^{\an}</m> are coherent, in order to resolve coherent sheaves on <m>X^{\an}</m> into pseudocoherent complexes.
          Since <m>X^{\an}</m> is a noetherian adic space this is okay.

        <p>
          We can then deduce the case <m>X = \PP^n_K</m> using a Segre embedding (or by imitating the proof of <xref ref="thm-gaga-liquid"/>);
          deduce the case where <m>X</m> is projective over <m>K</m> by pushing forward along the closed immersion;

        An analytic ring <m>A</m> is <term>Tate</term> if <m>A^{\gas}</m> contains a topologically nilpotent unit <m>q \in A(*)</m>;

        By <xref ref="cor-liquid-top-nilpotent-unit"/>, it follows that <m>A^{\gas}</m> contains <em>every</em> topologically nilpotent unit <m>q \in A(*)</m>.

        Replacing the Tate algebra <m>R \langle T \rangle</m> with the dagger Tate algebra <m>R \langle T \rangle^\dagger_q</m>
        is analogous to replacing the usual Tate algebra <m>K \langle T \rangle</m> over a nonarchimedean field, whose elements
        represent holomorphic functions on the closed unit disc, with the dagger Tate algebra <m>K \langle T \rangle^\dagger</m>,
        whose elements represent holomorphic functions on some disc of radius strictly greater than 1.
        The latter is more natural from the point of view of archimedean analysis; see for instance
        the proof of <xref ref="thm-gaga-classical-v2"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One feature we can take from this analogy is that <m>K \langle T \rangle^\dagger</m> can be equally well defined using
        a colimit over closed discs or open discs. Correspondingly, we can also define <m>\ZZ[q^{\pm}] \langle T \rangle^\dagger_q</m>
        as a colimit of copies over <m>\ZZ[q^{\pm}] \otimes P</m> with similar transition maps.

      <p>
        By analogy with <xref ref="rem-adjoin-top-nilpotent"/>, at certain points we will need to

        When this happens, by <xref ref="cor-liquid-top-nilpotent-unit"/> we will also have <m>R \in \Mod_{R \liquid r}</m>.

        We can force ourselves into this situation by replacing <m>R</m> with <m>R \otimes_{\liquid q} A^{\triangleright}</m>

      <proof>
        <p>
          To simplify notation we restrict to the case <m>n=1</m>, where the claim is that
          <me>
            R \langle T \rangle^\dagger_q \cong \colim_m R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}
          </me>.
          To produce the map from left to right, we first observe that the target belongs to <m>\Mod_{R[T]\liquid q}</m>;
          it thus suffices to map <m>\ZZ[q^{\pm}]\langle T \rangle^\dagger_q</m> to <m>\colim_m R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m>.
          This further reduces to mapping <m>\ZZ[q^{\pm}]\langle U \rangle</m> to <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^{m+1} q}</m>
          via <m>U \mapsto T^m q</m>; we deduce the claim here by writing
          <me>
            (T^m q)^n = (T^{m+1} q)^{\lfloor nm/(m+1) \rfloor} T^{nm-(m+1)\lfloor nm/(m+1)\rfloor} q^{n - \lfloor nm/(m+1) \rfloor}
          </me>
          and noting that the exponent of <m>q</m> is at least <m>n/(m+1) - 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To produce the map from right to left, we show that <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m> maps to
          <m>R \otimes_{\liquid q} \ZZ[q^{\pm}][T]_{\liquid T^{m+1}q}</m>.
          Since the claim is universal in <m>R</m>, it suffices to work at the level of global sections:
          a global section of <m>R[T]_{\liquid T^m q}</m> can be written as <m>\sum_n r_n T^n</m> with <m>r_n \in R(*)</m>
          such that <m>r_n q^{-\lfloor n/m \rfloor}</m> is a null sequence.
          By rewriting this as <m>r_n q^{-\lfloor n/(m+1) \rfloor}</m> times <m>q^{\lfloor n/m \rfloor - \lfloor n/(m+1) \rfloor}</m>
          and noting that the exponent is at least <m>n/(m(m+1)) - 1</m>, we see that the sum can be formed in 
          <m>R \otimes_{\liquid q} \ZZ[q^{\pm}][T]_{\liquid T^{m+1}q}</m>.

      <title>Schwartz lemma for Tate analytic rings</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a Tate analytic ring and fix <m>S \in \Prof</m>.
          Then for any trace class morphism <m>f\colon A[\underline{S}] \to A[\underline{S}]</m>,
          <m>\cone(f-1)</m> is isomorphic in <m>\calD(\Mod_{A})</m> to
          a complex of the form <m>A^{\triangleright n}[-1] \to A^{n}[0]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As in the proof of <xref ref="lem-trace-class"/>, we may lift to a setting where 
          <m>A^{\triangleright}</m> is represented by a topological ring which is itself Tate.
          Now using the fact that <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m> is open in <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>,
          we can imitate the proof of <xref ref="lem-trace-class"/>.

        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a Tate analytic ring, pullback along <m>\PP^1_{A} \to \PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> induces equivalences of categories (or stable <m>\infty</m>-categories) as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              pseudocoherent complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> to discrete pseudocoherent complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>;
            </li>
            <li>
              perfect complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> to discrete perfect complexes on <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>;
            </li>
            <li>
              vector bundles on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> to vector bundles on <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          In addition, if <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> is noetherian, we get an equivalence between coherent sheaves on <m>\PP^1_{A^{\triangleright}(*)}</m> and <m>\PP^1_{A}</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Using <xref ref="lem-trace-class-liquid"/>, we obtain an analogue of <xref ref="thm-pseudocoherent-descent"/>;
          we then argue as in <xref ref="thm-gaga-solid"/>.

          For <m>A</m> a Tate analytic ring, pullback along <m>\PP^1_{\underline{A}} \to \PP^1_A</m> induces an equivalence of categories between
          the stable <m>\infty</m>-category of complexes of quasicoherent sheaves on <m>\PP^1_A</m> with amplitude in <m>(-\infty, 0]</m> and the stable <m>\infty</m>-category of

        <p>
          For <m>X</m> a proper scheme over <m>\CC</m>, pullback along <m>X^{\an} \to X</m> induces an exact equivalence of categories between coherent sheaves on <m>X</m> and <m>X^{\an}</m>,
          which moreover preserves sheaf cohomology.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As in <xref ref="thm-gaga-classical-v3"/>, we reduce to the case
          <m>X = \PP^1_\CC \times_\CC \cdots \times_\CC \PP^1_\CC</m>, which we can then deduce from <xref ref="prop-compare-Tate-P1-to-analytic"/> and <xref ref="thm-gaga-liquid"/>
          once we know that the local rings of <m>X^{\an}</m> are coherent.
          This follows from a theorem of Frisch stating that the ring of holomorphic functions on a closed unit polydisc is noetherian
