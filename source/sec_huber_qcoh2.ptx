  <title>More on quasicoherent sheaves</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we apply localization for quasicoherent sheaves for solid analytic rings
      to deduce some related results for Huber rings, 
      including some whose statements make no reference to either solid rings or derived categories.
      We then set up a framework which will allow us to push beyond the solid case.

        This section is (rather loosely) based on <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-youtube"/>, Lectures 9 and 10.
        See also <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, Lecture 1 (for the version of the story using Huber rings)
        and <xref ref="bib-Andreychev"/> (for the solid analogue); the latter draws some key ideas from

    <title>Subcategories of the derived <m>\infty</m>-category of quasicoherent sheaves</title>
    <p>
      For <m>A</m> a solid analytic ring, we proved in <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> that the derived <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>
      is a sheaf for the adic topology on <m>\AnRing^{\op}_{\solid/A}</m>.
      We can formally transfer this conclusion to several subcategories thereof.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-subsheaves-of-qcoh">
      <p>
        <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> is compatible with various categorical properties.
        For instance, the bounded-above and bounded-below derived categories are also subsheaves for the adic topology.
        More precisely, from the proof of <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering"/>, we see that
        complexes with amplitude in a fixed range <m>[a, \infty)</m> also form a subsheaf for the adic topology.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the same token, complexes with amplitude in a fixed range <m>(-\infty, b]</m> also form a subsheaf for the loose adic topology.
        However, we cannot make the same argument for the adic topology: the passage from the right-hand
        side of <xref ref="eq-derived-base-extension-functor"/> to the left-hand side may increase <m>b</m> to <m>b+1</m>.

        An object <m>M</m> of <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m> is <term>dualizable</term> if there exist an object <m>N</m> of <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>
        and maps <m>i\colon A \to N\otimes M</m>, <m>e\colon M \otimes N \to A</m>
        for which the compositions

        are the identity maps.
        When this occurs, it follows as in <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0FFQ that for any <m>P,Q \in \calD(\Mod_A)</m>, there is a functorial isomorphism

        the passage from left to right is given by tensoring with <m>M</m> and postcomposing with <m>e</m>, while the passage from right to left
        is tensoring with <m>N</m> and precomposing with <m>i</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, when <m>M</m> is dualizable, <m>N</m> is also dualizable and
        <m>N \cong M^\vee</m> and <m>M \cong N^\vee</m>;.
        Moreover, <m>e</m> is the evaluation map and <m>i</m> is the map
        corresponding via <xref ref="eq-dual-functor"/> to the map <m>A \to \iHom_A(M, M)</m> carrying <m>1 \in A(*)</m> to the identity map
        in <m>\iHom_A(M,M)(*) = \Hom_A(M,M)</m>.
        With this, in the setting of <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/>, it is formal that the property of being dualizable defines a subsheaf
        of <m>\calD(\calA)</m>.

    <title>Glueing for adic spaces</title>
    <p>
      To help concretize the previous discussion, we deduce some consequences for glueing for solid analytic rings and sheafy Huber pairs.
      This depends on introducing one more categorical property of objects of <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>,
      this one serving as a mechanism to import a key idea from functional analysis (see <xref ref="lem-trace-class"/>).

    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> an analytic ring, an object <m>M \in \calD(\Mod_A)</m> is <term>nuclear</term> if for all <m>S \in \Prof</m>,
        the natural map
        <me>
          (A[\underline{S}]^\vee \otimes^L_A M)(*) \to \Hom_A(A[\underline{S}], M) = M(S)
        </me>
        is an isomorphism in <m>\calD(\Ab)</m>. The class of nuclear objects is stable under arbitrary colimits.
        It is straightforward to check that every dualizable object is nuclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we do not use this directly, in the setting of <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/>, it is formal that the property of being nuclear defines a subsheaf

      The following argument is in some sense the point;

          Then for any trace class morphism <m>f\colon A[\underline{S}] \to A[\underline{S}]</m>,
          <m>\cone(f-1)</m> is isomorphic in <m>\calD(\Mod_{A})</m> to
          a complex of the form <m>A^{\triangleright n}[-1] \to A^{\triangleright n}[0]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let us suppose first that <m>A</m> represents a Huber pair.
          By <xref ref="lem-identify-solidification-of-free"/>, we have <m>A[\underline{S}] \cong \prod_\NN A</m>.
          As in <xref ref="rem-dualizable-not-double-dual"/>, 
          we can represent the given element of <m>\Hom_{A}(A, A[\underline{S}]^\vee \otimes^L_{A} A[\underline{S}])</m> 
          as an <m>\NN \times \NN</m> matrix over <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> which is a convergent (for the operator topology)
          sum of matrices with finitely many nonzero columns. 
          In particular, it can be written as a sum of two matrices <m>N_0 + N_1</m> where <m>N_0</m> has finitely many nonzero columns
          and <m>N_1</m> has entries in <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m>. In particular, <m>1 - N_1</m> is invertible and so the cone of <m>f-1</m>
          does not change if we replace <m>N_0+N_1</m> with 
          <me>
            1 - (1+N_1+N_1^2+\cdots)(1-N_0-N_1) = (1-N_1)^{-1}N_0
          </me>,
          which is now itself a matrix with finitely many nonzero columns.
          We may thus replace the index set <m>\NN</m> with the subset corresponding to the nonzero columns without changing <m>\cone(f-1)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To handle the general case, note that the problem data can be described in terms of countably many elements of <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>;
          consequently, any given problem instance can be obtained by base extension from a solid analytic ring <m>A</m> 
          of the form
          <me>
            A^{\triangleright}\left( \prod_I \ZZ_\solid\right) = \prod_I R[T_j \colon j \in J]
          </me>
          for <m>R</m> a discrete polynomial ring over <m>\ZZ</m> in countably many variables and <m>J</m> a countable index set.
          Using <xref ref="exa-completion-of-coproduct"/>, we can interpret the given element of <m>\Hom_{A}(A, A[\underline{S}]^\vee \otimes^L_{A} A[\underline{S}])</m> 
          as an <m>\NN \times \NN</m> matrix over <m>R[T_j \colon j \in J]</m> with the property that every monomial <m>\prod_{j \in J} T_j^{e_j}</m>
          (where <m>e_j</m> are nonnegative integers, all but finitely many equal to 0) appears in only finitely many columns.
          We now argue as before: separate the matrix as <m>N_0 + N_1</m> where <m>N_0</m> is again the matrix of constant terms (i.e., set each <m>T_j</m> to 0),
          and then <m>1-N_1</m> will be invertible.

        It implies in particular that the category of vector bundles on <m>\Spa A</m> does not depend on <m>A^+</m>,
        whereas the full category of quasicoherent sheaves definitely does (<xref ref="prop-Huber-pair-to-solid-analytic"/>).
        In particular, the fact in that quasicoherent sheaves on affine schemes are colimits of vector bundles has no analogue in the analytic setting.

    <title>Idempotent morphisms</title>
    <p>
      Let us isolate the key point of the previous construction.
      This will give us a notion of an <q>open immersion</q> which applies to analytic rings which are not necessarily solid.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-idempotent-morphism">
      <p>
        A morphism <m>A \to B</m> of analytic rings is <term>idempotent</term> if 
        the map <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}</m> is an isomorphism.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-discrete-idempotent">
      <p>
        In the category of rings, any morphism <m>A \to B</m> which is a localization at an arbitrary multiplicative subset is idempotent.
        Consequently, such a morphism corresponds to an idempotent morphism of discrete analytic rings.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-idempotent-composition">
      <p>
        If <m>A \to B \to C</m> are two idempotent morphisms, then so is <m>A \to C</m> because
        <me>
          C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A C^{\triangleright} = C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_{B} (B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}) \otimes^L_B C^{\triangleright}
        </me>
        using both <m>B^{\triangleright}</m>-module structures on <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}</m>.
        Conversely, if <m>A \to B</m> and <m>A \to B \to C</m> are both idempotent, then so is <m>B \to C</m> because
        <me>
          C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_B C^{\triangleright} = (C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A C^{\triangleright}) \otimes_{B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}} B^{\triangleright}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A \to B</m> is idempotent, then for any morphism <m>A \to C</m>, <m>C \to B \otimes_A C</m> is idempotent.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="eq-Zariski-localization-idempotent">
      <p>
        By base extension from the case <m>\ZZ[f] \to \ZZ[f^{\pm}]</m> of <xref ref="exa-discrete-idempotent"/>,
        for any analytic ring <m>A</m> and any <m>f \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>,
        the morphism <m>A \to A_f := A[T]/(1-fT)</m> is idempotent.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-rational-localization-is-idempotent">
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring.
        Let <m>A \to B</m> be a rational localization or loose rational localization defined by some parameters <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g</m> that generate the unit ideal.
        By <xref ref="rem-localization-is-underived"/>, <m>B \otimes^L_A B</m> is underived;
        we may then conclude that <m>A \to B</m> is idempotent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, any composition of loose rational localizations is idempotent, whether or not it is again a rational localization
        (<xref ref="rem-compose-rational-localizations"/>). Similarly, any tensor product of loose rational localizations is idempotent.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-completion-is-idempotent">
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring, choose <m>f \in A(*)</m>, and let <m>B</m> denote the derived <m>f</m>-completion of <m>A</m>;
        that is, for 
        <me>
          A_f := \coker(1-fT, A^{\triangleright}[T])
        </me>,
        we have <m>B^{\triangleright} = \iExt^1_A(A_f/A, B)</m>
        and <m>\Mod_B := \Mod_{B^{\triangleright}} \times_{\Mod_{A^{\triangleright}}} \Mod_A</m>.
        If <m>B^{\triangleright}</m> is also the derived derived <m>f</m>-completion of <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>
        (that is, <m>\iHom_A(A_f/A, B) = 0</m>), then <m>A \to B</m> is idempotent:
        we may deduce this from the universal case <m>A = \underline{\ZZ[T]}</m>, <m>f = T</m>
        which follows from <xref ref="lem-tensor-product-over-R"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note however that the objects of <m>B</m> are not themselves derived <m>f</m>-complete;
        that is, so far we did not restrict <m>\Mod_B</m> to consist only of those objects in 
        <m>\Mod_{B^{\triangleright}} \times_{\Mod_{A^{\triangleright}}} \Mod_A</m> 
        such that <m>R\iHom_{B^{\triangleright}}(A_f, M) = 0</m>.
        If we were to impose that additional restriction, we would obtain a distinct morphism of analytic rings,
        which would again be idempotent.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="eq-sequence-space-idempotent">
      <p>
        For <m>P = \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> the sequence space,
        equip <m>\ZZ[q]</m> with the discrete topology and form the morphism <m>\underline{\ZZ[q]} \to P</m> of condensed rings taking <m>q</m> to <m>[1]</m>.
        Then the corresponding morphism of discrete analytic rings is idempotent.
        (Remember, taking <m>P</m> to be a <q>discrete</q> analytic ring makes sense even though <m>P</m> is not a discrete ring;
        it just means take the module category to be all of <m>\Mod_P</m>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that <m>\underline{\ZZ[q]} \to P</m> is flat, we may argue as in <xref ref="lem-flat-mult-f"/>:
        form the exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to \underline{\ZZ[q]} \otimes P \stackrel{\times (q-[1])}{\to} \underline{\ZZ[q]} \otimes P \to P \to 0
        </me>,
        then observe that for any <m>M \in \Mod_{\underline{\ZZ[q]}}</m>, <m>M \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ[q]}} \underline{\ZZ[q]} \otimes P \cong M \otimes P</m>
        injects into <m>M \otimes (P \oplus \prod_{n \lt 0} \ZZ[n])</m>
        on which multiplication by <m>q-[1] = [1](1 - q[-1])</m> is an isomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that <m>P \otimes_{\underline{\ZZ[q]}} P \cong P</m>, first apply <xref ref="eq-tensor-product-of-profinite"/> and <xref ref="rem-tensor-free-ab-flat"/> to write
        <me>
          \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \otimes^L_{\underline{\ZZ}} \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \cong \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty \times \NN_\infty}]
        </me>.
        Then set <m>Z := (\NN_\infty \times \NN_\infty) \setminus (\NN \times \NN)</m>; using <xref ref="prop-relative-free-module"/>,
        we obtain
        <me>
          (\ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}] \otimes^L_{\underline{\ZZ}} \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}])/\ZZ[\underline{Z}] \cong \ZZ[\underline{(\NN \times \NN)_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]
        </me> 
        where <m>(\NN \times \NN)_\infty</m> is the one-point compactification of <m>\NN \times \NN</m>.
        Finally, note that 
        <me>
          (\ZZ[\underline{(\NN \times \NN)_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}])/(q \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes q) \cong P
        </me>.
