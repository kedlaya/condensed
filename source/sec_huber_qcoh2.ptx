  <title>More on quasicoherent sheaves</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we apply localization for quasicoherent sheaves for solid analytic rings
      to deduce some related results for Huber rings, 
      including some whose statements make no reference to either solid rings or derived categories.
      We then set up a framework which will allow us to push beyond the solid case.

        This section is (rather loosely) based on <xref ref="bib-Clausen-Scholze-youtube"/>, Lectures 9 and 10.
        See also <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/>, Lecture 1 (for the version of the story using Huber rings)
        and <xref ref="bib-Andreychev"/> (for the solid analogue); the latter draws some key ideas from

    <title>Subcategories of the derived <m>\infty</m>-category of quasicoherent sheaves</title>
    <p>
      For <m>A</m> a sheafy solid analytic ring, we proved in <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> that the derived <m>\infty</m>-category <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>
      is a sheaf for the adic topology on <m>\AnRing^{\op}_{\solid/A}</m>.
      We can formally transfer this conclusion to several subcategories thereof.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rem-subsheaves-of-qcoh">
      <p>
        <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/> is compatible with various categorical properties.
        For instance, the bounded-above and bounded-below derived categories are also subsheaves for the adic topology.
        However, we cannot argue that complexes in a fixed range <m>[a, \infty)</m> or <m>(-\infty, b]</m> also form a subsheaf for the adic topology:
        the argument in <xref ref="lem-descent-standard-covering-loose"/> includes a step that disturbs the left end of the range
        (taking the derived tensor product with <m>M</m>) and a step that disturbs the right end of the range (taking the mapping cone).

        commutes with filtered colimits. The object <m>M</m> is <term>pseudocoherent</term> if for any <m>a</m>, the truncation to <m>[a, \infty)</m>

        and maps <m>i\colon A \to N\otimes M</m>, <m>e\colon M \otimes N \to A</m>
        for which the compositions

          <mrow>
            M \stackrel{1 \otimes i}{\to} M \otimes^L_A (N \otimes^L_A M) \cong (M \otimes^L_A N) \otimes^L_A M \stackrel{e \otimes 1}{\to} M

        When this occurs, it follows as in <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0FFQ that for any <m>P,Q \in \calD(\Mod_A)</m>, there is a functorial isomorphism
        <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-dual-functor">

        the passage from left to right is given by tensoring with <m>M</m> and postcomposing with <m>e</m>, while the passage from right to left
        is tensoring with <m>N</m> and precomposing with <m>i</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, when <m>M</m> is dualizable, <m>N</m> is also dualizable and
        <m>N \cong M^\vee</m> and <m>M \cong N^\vee</m>;.
        Moreover, <m>e</m> is the evaluation map and <m>i</m> is the map
        corresponding via <xref ref="eq-dual-functor"/> to the map <m>A \to \iHom_A(M, M)</m> carrying <m>1 \in A(*)</m> to the identity map
        in <m>\iHom_A(M,M)(*) = \Hom_A(M,M)</m>.
        With this, in the setting of <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/>, it is formal that the property of being dualizable defines a subsheaf
        of <m>\calD(\calA)</m>.
      </p>

        Any dualizable object is reflexive, but not vice versa; see <xref ref="rem-pseudocoherent-over-ring"/>

    <title>Glueing for adic spaces</title>
    <p>
      To help concretize the previous discussion, we deduce some consequences for glueing for solid analytic rings and sheafy Huber pairs.
      This depends on introducing one more categorical property of objects of <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>,
      this one serving as a mechanism to import a key idea from functional analysis (see <xref ref="lem-trace-class"/>).
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>A</m> an analytic ring, an object <m>M \in \calD(\Mod_A)</m> is <term>nuclear</term> if for all <m>S \in \Prof</m>,
        the natural map
        <md>
          (A[\underline{S}]^\vee \otimes^L_A M)(*) \to \Hom_A(A[\underline{S}], M) = M(S)
        </md>
        is an isomorphism in <m>\calD(\Ab)</m>. The class of nuclear objects is stable under arbitrary colimits.
        It is straightforward to check that every dualizable object is nuclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we do not use this directly, in the setting of <xref ref="thm-sheaf-qcoh-for-adic"/>, it is formal that the property of being nuclear defines a subsheaf
        of <m>\calD(\Mod_A)</m>.

      The following argument is in some sense the point;

          Then for any trace class morphism <m>f\colon A[\underline{S}] \to A[\underline{S}]</m>,
          <m>\cone(f-1)</m> is isomorphic in <m>\calD(\Mod_{A})</m> to
          a complex of the form <m>A^{\triangleright n}[-1] \to A^{\triangleright n}[0]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let us suppose first that <m>A</m> represents a Huber pair.
          By <xref ref="lem-identify-solidification-of-free"/>, we have <m>A[\underline{S}] \cong \prod_\NN A</m>.
          As in <xref ref="rem-dualizable-not-double-dual"/>, 
          we can represent the given element of <m>\Hom_{A}(A, A[\underline{S}]^\vee \otimes^L_{A} A[\underline{S}])</m> 
          as an <m>\NN \times \NN</m> matrix over <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m> which is a convergent (for the operator topology)
          sum of matrices with finitely many nonzero columns. 
          In particular, it can be written as a sum of two matrices <m>N_0 + N_1</m> where <m>N_0</m> has finitely many nonzero columns
          and <m>N_1</m> has entries in <m>A^{\circ \circ}</m>. In particular, <m>1 - N_1</m> is invertible and so the cone of <m>f-1</m>
          does not change if we replace <m>N_0+N_1</m> with 
          <md>
            1 - (1+N_1+N_1^2+\cdots)(1-N_0-N_1) = (1-N_1)^{-1}N_0
          </md>,
          which is now itself a matrix with finitely many nonzero columns.
          We may thus replace the index set <m>\NN</m> with the subset corresponding to the nonzero columns without changing <m>\cone(f-1)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To handle the general case, note that the problem data can be described in terms of countably many elements of <m>A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>;
          consequently, any given problem instance can be obtained by base extension from a solid analytic ring <m>A</m> 
          of the form
          <md>
            A^{\triangleright}\left( \prod_I \ZZ_\solid\right) = \prod_I R[T_j \colon j \in J]
          </md>
          for <m>R</m> a discrete polynomial ring over <m>\ZZ</m> in countably many variables and <m>J</m> a countable index set.
          Using <xref ref="exa-completion-of-coproduct"/>, we can interpret the given element of <m>\Hom_{A}(A, A[\underline{S}]^\vee \otimes^L_{A} A[\underline{S}])</m> 
          as an <m>\NN \times \NN</m> matrix over <m>R[T_j \colon j \in J]</m> with the property that every monomial <m>\prod_{j \in J} T_j^{e_j}</m>
          (where <m>e_j</m> are nonnegative integers, all but finitely many equal to 0) appears in only finitely many columns.
          We now argue as before: separate the matrix as <m>N_0 + N_1</m> where <m>N_0</m> is again the matrix of constant terms (i.e., set each <m>T_j</m> to 0),
          and then <m>1-N_1</m> will be invertible.

    <title>Idempotent morphisms</title>
    <p>
      Let us isolate the key point of the previous construction.
      This will give us a notion of an <q>open immersion</q> which applies to analytic rings which are not necessarily solid.
      (We persist in retaining sheafiness conditions because we do not expand upon <xref ref="rem-more-homotopical-rings"/>.)

        A morphism <m>A \to B</m> of analytic rings is <term>idempotent</term> if 
        the map <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright}</m> is an isomorphism.
        An equivalent condition is that the composition
        <md number="yes" xml:id="eq-idempotent-composition">
          B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright} \to B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}
        </md>,
        where the second map is <m>b \mapsto b \otimes 1</m>, is an isomorphism.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-discrete-idempotent">
      <p>
        In the category of rings, any morphism <m>A \to B</m> which is a localization at an arbitrary multiplicative subset is idempotent.
        Consequently, such a morphism corresponds to an idempotent morphism of discrete analytic rings.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rem-idempotent-composition">
      <p>
        If <m>A \to B \to C</m> are two idempotent morphisms, then so is <m>A \to C</m> because
        <md>
          C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A C^{\triangleright} = C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_{B} (B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}) \otimes^L_B C^{\triangleright}
        </md>
        using both <m>B^{\triangleright}</m>-module structures on <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}</m>.
        Conversely, if <m>A \to B</m> and <m>A \to B \to C</m> are both idempotent, then so is <m>B \to C</m> because
        <md>
          C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_B C^{\triangleright} = (C^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A C^{\triangleright}) \otimes_{B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}} B^{\triangleright}

        If <m>A \to B</m> is idempotent, then for any morphism <m>A \to C</m>, <m>C \to B \otimes_A C</m> is idempotent
        provided that <m>B \otimes_A C = B \otimes^L_A \otimes C</m>. When this fails (as in <xref ref="rem-localization-is-idempotent"/>), 
        it is the morphism <m>C \to B \otimes^L_A C</m> that should be regarded as being idempotent,
        by interpreting the target as a derived ring in a suitable sense (<xref ref="rem-more-homotopical-rings"/>).

        By base extension from the case <m>\ZZ[f] \to \ZZ[f^{\pm}]</m> of <xref ref="exa-discrete-idempotent"/>,
        for analytic ring <m>A</m> and any <m>f \in A^{\triangleright}(*)</m>,
        the morphism <m>A \to A_f := A[T]/(1-fT)</m> is idempotent.

        Let <m>A</m> be a sheafy solid analytic ring.
        Let <m>A \to B</m> be a rational localization defined by some parameters <m>f_1,\dots,f_n,g</m> that generate the unit ideal.
        Then <m>A \to B</m> is idempotent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, any composition of rational localizations is idempotent, whether or not it is again a rational localization
        (<xref ref="rem-compose-rational-localizations"/>). Similarly, any tensor product of rational localizations is idempotent
        (provided that it is underived).

    <remark xml:id="rem-localization-is-idempotent">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-rational-localization-is-idempotent"/>, if we drop the condition that <m>A</m> is sheafy 
        but require that <m>A \to B</m> coincide with the associated derived rational localization (<xref ref="rem-not-flat"/>), then <m>A \to B</m> is still idempotent;
        that is, <xref ref="eq-idempotent-composition"/> is still an isomorphism.

      <p>
        Let us work this out in the special case where <m>B = A \langle f \rangle</m> for some <m>f \in A^{\triangleright}</m>,
        the general case being similar.
        In this case <m>B^{\triangleright}</m> is represented by the Koszul complex associated to the element <m>T-f</m>
        of <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T \rangle</m>, and so 
        <m>B^{\triangleright} \otimes^L_A B^{\triangleright}</m> is represented by the Koszul complex associated to the elements <m>T-f,U-f</m>
        of <m>A^{\triangleright} \langle T,U \rangle</m>. The Koszul complex does not change if we replace the sequence with <m>T-U,T-f</m>;
        it thus suffices to observe that the sequence
        <md>
          0 \to A^{\triangleright}\langle T,U \rangle \stackrel{\times T-U}{\to} A^{\triangleright}\langle T,U \rangle \stackrel{U \mapsto T}{\to} A^{\triangleright}\langle T \rangle \to 0
        </md>
        is <em>split</em> exact.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, by <xref ref="cor-flat-mult-f-v2"/>, the morphisms <m>A \to A \langle f \rangle</m> and <m>A \to A \langle f^{-1} \rangle</m>
        are idempotent. However, by <xref ref="rem-not-flat"/>, the morphism <m>A \to A \langle f^{\pm} \rangle</m> is not necessarily idempotent.

    <example xml:id="exa-completion-is-idempotent">

        Let <m>A</m> be a solid analytic ring, choose <m>f \in A(*)</m>, and let <m>B</m> denote the derived <m>f</m>-completion of <m>A</m>;
        that is, for 
        <md>
          A_f := \coker(1-fT, A^{\triangleright}[T])
        </md>,
        we have <m>B^{\triangleright} = \iExt^1_A(A_f/A, B)</m>
        and <m>\Mod_B := \Mod_{B^{\triangleright}} \times_{\Mod_{A^{\triangleright}}} \Mod_A</m>.
        If <m>B^{\triangleright}</m> is also the derived derived <m>f</m>-completion of <m>A^{\triangleright}</m>
        (that is, <m>\iHom_A(A_f/A, B) = 0</m>), then <m>A \to B</m> is idempotent:
        we may deduce this from the universal case <m>A = \underline{\ZZ[T]}</m>, <m>f = T</m>
        which follows from <xref ref="lem-tensor-product-over-R"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note however that the objects of <m>B</m> are not themselves derived <m>f</m>-complete;
        that is, so far we did not restrict <m>\Mod_B</m> to consist only of those objects in 
        <m>\Mod_{B^{\triangleright}} \times_{\Mod_{A^{\triangleright}}} \Mod_A</m> 
        such that <m>R\iHom_{B^{\triangleright}}(A_f, M) = 0</m>.
        If we were to impose that additional restriction, we would obtain a distinct morphism of analytic rings,
        which would again be idempotent.

        For <m>P = \ZZ[\underline{\NN_\infty}]/\ZZ[\underline{\infty}]</m> the sequence space,

        Then the corresponding morphism of discrete analytic rings is idempotent.
        (Remember, taking <m>P</m> to be a <q>discrete</q> analytic ring makes sense even though <m>P</m> is not a discrete ring;
        it just means take the module category to be all of <m>\Mod_P</m>.)

        Then set <m>Z := (\NN_\infty \times \NN_\infty) \setminus (\NN \times \NN)</m>; using <xref ref="prop-relative-free-module"/>,
